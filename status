Description: A simple VoIP corporate directory enumeration tool
 ACE (Automated Corporate Enumerator) is a simple yet powerful
 VoIP Corporate Directory enumeration tool that mimics the behavior
 of an IP Phone in order to download the name and extension entries
 that a given phone can display on its screen interface. In the
 same way that the "corporate directory" feature of VoIP hardphones
 enables users to easily dial by name via their VoIP handsets, ACE
 was developed as a research idea born from "VoIP Hopper" to
 automate VoIP attacks that can be targeted against names in an
 enterprise Directory. The concept is that in the future, attacks
 will be carried out against users based on their name, rather than
 targeting VoIP traffic against random RTP audio streams or IP
 addresses. ACE works by using DHCP, TFTP, and HTTP in order to
 download the VoIP corporate directory. It then outputs the
 directory to a text file, which can be used as input to other
 VoIP assessment tools.

    group.
 .
 Adding users with 'adduser' is much easier than adding them manually.
 Adduser will choose appropriate UID and GID values, create a home
 directory, copy skeletal user configuration, and automate setting
 initial values for the user's password, real name and so on.
 .
 Deluser can back up and remove users' home directories
 and mail spool or all the files they own on the system.

Description: Advanced Forensics Format Library (utilities)
 The Advanced Forensic Format (AFF) is on-disk format for storing
 computer forensic information. Critical features of AFF include:
 .
  - AFF allows you to store both computer forensic data and associated
    metadata in one or more files.
  - AFF allows files to be digital signed, to provide for
    chain-of-custody and long-term file integrity.
  - AFF allows for forensic disk images to stored encrypted and
    decrypted on-the-fly for processing. This allows disk images
    containing privacy sensitive material to be stored on the Internet.
 .
 This package provides the AFF Toolkit, that is a set of programs for
 working with computer forensic information. Using these tools you can:
  * Interconvert disk images between a variety of formats, including:
      - raw or "dd";
      - splitraw (in which a single image is split between multiple files);
      - AFF format (in which the entire disk image is stored in a single
        file);
      - AFD format (in which a disk image is stored in multiple AFF files
        stored in a single directory);
      - AFM format (in which an AFF file is used to annotate a raw file).
  * Compare disk images and report the data or metadata that is different.
  * Copy disk images from one location to another, with full verification
    of data, metadata, and the automatic generation of a chain-of-custody
    segment.
  * Find errors in an AFF file and fix them.
  * Print information about a file.
  * Print detailed statistics about a file
  * Generate a XML representation of a disk image's metadata (for example,
    acquisition time or the serial number of the acquisition device).
  * Produce a XML "diskprint" which allows a disk image to be rapidly
    fingerprinted without having the computer the SHA1 of the entire
    disk.
 .
 The AFF Toolkit provides these executables: affcat, affcompare, affconvert,
 affcopy, affcrypto, affdiskprint, affinfo, affix, affrecover, affsegment,
 affsign, affstats, affuse, affverify and affxml.

 It implements the standard FMS attack along with some optimizations,
 thus making the attack much faster compared to other WEP cracking tools.
 It can also fully use a multiprocessor system to its full power in order
 to speed up the cracking process.

Description: Google's internal fork of OpenSSL for the Android SDK
 The Android SDK builds against a static version of BoringSSL,
 Google's internal fork of OpenSSL.  This package should never be used
 for anything but Android SDK packages that already depend on it.
 .
 BoringSSL arose because Google used OpenSSL for many years in various
 ways and, over time, built up a large number of patches that were
 maintained while tracking upstream OpenSSL. As Google’s product
 portfolio became more complex, more copies of OpenSSL sprung up and
 the effort involved in maintaining all these patches in multiple
 places was growing steadily.
 .
 This is the Android AOSP fork of BoringSSL which is designed to be
 used by Android and its SDK.  BoringSSL is only ever statically linked
 into apps, and pinned to a commit version.  Upstream has no official
 releases of BoringSSL on its own, so it must be included separately
 for each project that uses it.

Description: Automated Password Generator - Standalone version
 APG (Automated Password Generator) is the tool set for random
 password generation. It generates some random words of required type
 and prints them to standard output. This binary package contains only
 the standalone version of apg.
 Advantages:
  * Built-in ANSI X9.17 RNG (Random Number Generator)(CAST/SHA1)
  * Built-in password quality checking system (now it has support for Bloom
    filter for faster access)
  * Two Password Generation Algorithms:
     1. Pronounceable Password Generation Algorithm (according to NIST
        FIPS 181)
     2. Random Character Password Generation Algorithm with 35
        configurable modes of operation
  * Configurable password length parameters
  * Configurable amount of generated passwords
  * Ability to initialize RNG with user string
  * Support for /dev/random
  * Ability to crypt() generated passwords and print them as additional output.
  * Special parameters to use APG in script
  * Ability to log password generation requests for network version
  * Ability to control APG service access using tcpd
  * Ability to use password generation service from any type of box (Mac,
    WinXX, etc.) that connected to network
  * Ability to enforce remote users to use only allowed type of password
    generation
 The client/server version of apg has been deliberately omitted.
 .
 Please note that there are security flaws in pronounceable
 password generation schemes (see Ganesan / Davis "A New Attack on
 Random Pronounceable Password Generators", in "Proceedings of the 17th
 National Computer Security Conference (NCSC), Oct. 11-14, 1994
 (Volume 1)", http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/history/nissc/
 1994-17th-NCSC-proceedings-vol-1.pdf, pages 203-216)
 .
 Also note that the FIPS 181 standard from 1993 has been withdrawn by NIST in
 2015 with no superseding publication. This means that the document is
 considered by its publicher as obsolete and not been updated to reference
 current or revised voluntary industry standards, federal specifications, or
 federal data standards.
 .
 apg has not seen upstream attention since 2003, upstream is not
 answering e-mail, and the upstream web page does not look like it is
 in good working order. The Debian maintainer plans to discontinue apg
 maintenance as soon as an actually maintained software with a
 compariable feature set becomes available.

Description: tool for reverse engineering Android apk files
 A tool for reverse engineering 3rd party, closed, binary Android apps. It can
 decode resources to nearly original form and rebuild them after making some
 modifications; it makes possible to debug smali code step by step. Also it
 makes working with an app easier because of project-like file structure and
 automation of some repetitive tasks like building apk.

 layers, and it shows for every active process the CPU utilization in system
 and user mode, the virtual and resident memory growth, priority, username,
 state, and exit code. The process level activity is also shown for processes
 which finished during the last interval, to get a complete overview about the
 consumers of things such as CPU time.

Description: Tool for generating GNU Standards-compliant Makefiles
 Automake is a tool for automatically generating `Makefile.in's from

 .
 The goal of Automake is to remove the burden of Makefile maintenance
 from the back of the individual GNU maintainer (and put it on the back
 of the Automake maintainer).
 .
 The `Makefile.am' is basically a series of `make' macro definitions
 (with rules being thrown in occasionally).  The generated
 `Makefile.in's are compliant with the GNU Makefile standards.
 .
 Automake 1.16 fails to work in a number of situations that Automake
 1.11, and 1.15 did, so some previous versions are available as separate

 BeEF is short for The Browser Exploitation Framework. It is a penetration
 testing tool that focuses on the web browser.
 .
 Amid growing concerns about web-born attacks against clients, including
 mobile clients, BeEF allows the professional penetration tester to assess the
 actual security posture of a target environment by using client-side attack
 vectors. Unlike other security frameworks, BeEF looks past the hardened
 network perimeter and client system, and examines exploitability within the
 context of the one open door: the web browser. BeEF will hook one or more web
 browsers and use them as beachheads for launching directed command modules and
 further attacks against the system from within the browser context.

Description: tool library for analyzing binary blobs and executable code
 Binwalk is a tool for searching a given binary image for embedded files
 and executable code. Specifically, it is designed for identifying files
 and code embedded inside of firmware images. Binwalk uses the libmagic
 library, so it is compatible with magic signatures created for the Unix
 file utility.
 .
 Binwalk also includes a custom magic signature file which contains
 improved signatures for files that are commonly found in firmware images
 such as compressed/archived files, firmware headers, Linux kernels,
 bootloaders, filesystems, etc.
 .
 This package is an empty package, because the binary tool is already

 BlueRanger is a simple Bash script which uses Link
 Quality to locate Bluetooth device radios. It sends
 l2cap (Bluetooth) pings to create a connection
 between Bluetooth interfaces, since most devices
 allow pings without any authentication or
 authorization. The higher the link quality, the
 closer the device (in theory).
 .
 Use a Bluetooth Class 1 adapter for long range
 location detection. Switch to a Class 3 adapter
 for more precise short range locating. The
 recision and accuracy depend on the build quality
 of the Bluetooth adapter, interference, and response
 from the remote device. Fluctuations may occur even
 when neither device is in motion.

 Thunderbolt 3 features different security modes that require
 devices to be authorized before they can be used. The D-Bus API can be
 used to list devices, enroll them (authorize and store them in the
 local database) and forget them again (remove previously enrolled
 devices). It also emits signals if new devices are connected (or
 removed). During enrollment devices can be set to be automatically
 authorized as soon as they are connected.  A command line tool, called
 boltctl, can be used to control the daemon and perform all the above
 mentioned tasks.

Description: Mass SNMP scanner
 Braa is a mass snmp scanner. The intended usage of such a tool is of course
 making SNMP queries - but unlike snmpget or snmpwalk from net-snmp, it is able
 to query dozens or hundreds of hosts simultaneously, and in a single process.
 Thus, it consumes very few system resources and does the scanning VERY fast.
 .
 Braa implements its OWN snmp stack, so it does NOT need any SNMP libraries
 like net-snmp. The implementation is very dirty, supports only several data
 types, and in any case cannot be stated 'standard-conforming'! It was designed
 to be fast, and it is fast. For this reason (well, and also because of author
 laziness ;), there is no ASN.1 parser in braa - the user HAVE to know the
 numerical values of OID's
 (for instance .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0 instead of system.sysName.0).

 If you have this package installed, you only need to install whatever
 a package specifies as its build-time dependencies to build the
 package.  Conversely, if you are determining what your package needs
 to build-depend on, you can always leave out the packages this
 package depends on.

Description: high-quality block-sorting file compressor - utilities
 bzip2 is a freely available, patent free, data compressor.
 .
 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding.  Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
 family of statistical compressors.
 .
 The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its
 predecessor, bzip (.bz).

Description: Cisco device scanner
 The main feature that makes cisco-torch different from
 similar tools is the extensive use of forking  to launch
 multiple scanning processes on the background for maximum
 scanning efficiency. Also, it uses several methods of
 application layer fingerprinting simultaneoulsy, if needed.
 We wanted something fast to discover remote Cisco hosts
 running Telnet, SSH, Web, NTP, TFTP and SNMP services and
 launch dicitionary attacks against the services discovered,
 including SNMP community attack (you would like the
 community.txt list :-) and TFTP servers (configuration
 file name bruteforcing with following config leeching). The
 tool can also get device configurationfiles automatically
 if SNMP RW community is found.

Description: anti-virus utility for Unix - command-line interface
 Clam AntiVirus is an anti-virus toolkit for Unix. The main purpose of
 this software is the integration with mail servers (attachment
 scanning). The package provides a flexible and scalable
 multi-threaded daemon in the clamav-daemon package, a command-line
 scanner in the clamav package, and a tool for automatic updating via
 the Internet in the clamav-freshclam package. The programs are based
 on libclamav, which can be used by other software.
 .
 This package contains the command line interface. Features:
  - built-in support for various archive formats, including Zip, Tar,
    Gzip, Bzip2, OLE2, Cabinet, CHM, BinHex, SIS and others;
  - built-in support for almost all mail file formats;
  - built-in support for ELF executables and Portable Executable files
    compressed with UPX, FSG, Petite, NsPack, wwpack32, MEW, Upack and
    obfuscated with SUE, Y0da Cryptor and others;
  - built-in support for popular document formats including Microsoft
    Office and Mac Office files, HTML, RTF and PDF.
 .
 For scanning to work, a virus database is needed. There are two options
 for getting it:
  - clamav-freshclam: updates the database from Internet. This is
    recommended with Internet access.
  - clamav-data: for users without Internet access. The package is
    not updated once installed. The clamav-getfiles package allows
    creating custom packages from an Internet-connected computer.

Description: console font and keymap setup program
 This package provides the console with the same keyboard
 configuration scheme as the X Window System. As a result, there is no
 need to duplicate or change the keyboard files just to make simple
 customizations such as the use of dead keys, the key functioning as
 AltGr or Compose key, the key(s) to switch between Latin and
 non-Latin mode, etc.
 .
 The package also installs console fonts supporting many of the
 world's languages.  It provides an unified set of font faces - the
 classic VGA, the simplistic Fixed, and the cleaned Terminus,
 TerminusBold and TerminusBoldVGA.

 .
 Output from the commands is usually mailed to the system administrator
 (or to the user in question); you should probably install a mail system
 as well so that you can receive these messages.

 This cron package does not provide any system maintenance tasks. Basic
 periodic maintenance tasks are provided by other packages, such

Description: simple interprocess messaging system (daemon and utilities)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.
 .
 This package contains the D-Bus daemon and related utilities.
 .
 The client-side library can be found in the libdbus-1-3 package, as it is no
 longer contained in this package.

Description: simple interprocess messaging system (systemd --user integration)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 On systemd systems, this package opts in to the session model in which
 a user's session starts the first time they log in, and does not end
 until all their login sessions have ended. This model merges all
 parallel non-graphical login sessions (text mode, ssh, cron, etc.), and up
 to one graphical session, into a single "user-session" or "super-session"
 within which all background D-Bus services are shared.
 .
 Multiple graphical sessions per user are not currently supported in this
 mode; as a result, it is particularly suitable for gdm, which responds to
 requests to open a parallel graphical session by switching to the existing
 graphical session and unlocking it.
 .
 To retain dbus' traditional session semantics, in which login sessions
 are artificially isolated from each other, remove this package and install
 dbus-x11 instead.
 .

 space, splice zerocopy, and bypassing the kernel pagecache with O_DIRECT.
 dd_rescue provides safe deletion of data by overwriting files (or better
 partitions/disks) multiple times with fast random numbers.
 With the ddr_hash plugin, it supports calculating a hash value (such as
 a sha256sum) or an HMAC during copying.

Description: Performs testing against flash remoting endpoints
 Through the use of the Flex programming model and the ActionScript language,
 Flash Remoting was born. Flash applications can make request to a remote server
 to call server side functions, such as looking up accounts, retrieving
 additional data and graphics, and performing complex business operations.
 However, the ability to call remote methods also increases the attack surface
 exposed by these applications.
 .
 This tool will allow you to perform method enumeration and interrogation
 against flash remoting end points.  Deblaze came about as a necessity during a
 few security assessments of flash based websites that made heavy use of flash
 remoting. I needed something to give me the ability to dig a little deeper into
 the technology and identify security holes.  On all of the servers I've seen so
 far the names are not case sensitive, making it much easier to bruteforce.
 Often times HTTP POST requests won't be logged by the server, so bruteforcing
 may go unnoticed on poorly monitored systems.

 The diffutils package provides the diff, diff3, sdiff, and cmp programs.
 .
 `diff' shows differences between two files, or each corresponding file
 in two directories.  `cmp' shows the offsets and line numbers where
 two files differ.  `cmp' can also show all the characters that
 differ between the two files, side by side.  `diff3' shows differences
 among three files.  `sdiff' merges two files interactively.
 .
 The set of differences produced by `diff' can be used to distribute
 updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people.
 This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared
 to the complete files.  Given `diff' output, the `patch' program can
 update, or "patch", a copy of the file.

 DIRB is a Web Content Scanner. It looks for existing (and/or hidden) Web
 Objects. It basically works by launching a dictionary based attack against

 .
 DIRB comes with a set of preconfigured attack wordlists for easy usage but
 you can use your custom wordlists. Also DIRB sometimes can be used as a
 classic CGI scanner, but remember that it is a content scanner not a
 vulnerability scanner.
 .
 DIRB's main purpose is to help in professional web application auditing.
 Specially in security related testing. It covers some holes not covered by
 classic web vulnerability scanners. DIRB looks for specific web objects that
 other generic CGI scanners can't look for. It doesn't search vulnerabilities
 nor does it look for web contents that can be vulnerable.

Description: Web server directory brute-forcer
 DirBuster is a multi threaded java application designed to
 brute force directories and files names on web/application
 servers. Often is the case now of what looks like a web
 server in a state of default installation is actually not,
 and has pages and applications hidden within. DirBuster
 attempts to find these.
 .
 However tools of this nature are often as only good as the
 directory and file list they come with. A different
 approach was taken to generating this. The list was
 generated from scratch, by crawling the Internet and
 collecting the directory and files that are actually used
 by developers! DirBuster comes a total of 9 different
 lists, this makes DirBuster extremely effective at finding
 those hidden files and directories. And if that was not
 enough DirBuster also has the option to perform a pure
 brute force, which leaves the hidden directories and files
 nowhere to hide.

 This information typically includes system manufacturer, model name, serial
 number, BIOS version, asset tag as well as a lot of other details of varying
 level of interest and reliability depending on the manufacturer. This will
 often include usage status for the CPU sockets, expansion slots (e.g. AGP, PCI,
 ISA) and memory module slots, and the list of I/O ports (e.g. serial, parallel,
 USB).
 .
 Beware that DMI data have proven to be too unreliable to be blindly trusted.
 Dmidecode does not scan the hardware, it only reports what the BIOS told it to.

 The framework use a client/server architecture. The server
 knows what to do and the clients do it. All the logic and
 statistics are managed in the server. Nmap output is stored
 on both server and client.
 Usually you would want this if you have to scan a large

 6) Brute force subdomains from file, can also perform
 recursion on subdomain that have NS records (all threaded).
 7) Calculate C class domain network ranges and perform
 whois queries on them (threaded).
 8) Perform reverse lookups on netranges ( C class or/and

Description: DNS domain name brute forcing tool
 dnsmap was originally released back in 2006 and was
 inspired by the fictional story "The Thief No One Saw" by
 Paul Craig, which can be found in the book "Stealing the
 Network - How to 0wn the Box".
 .
 dnsmap is mainly meant to be used by pentesters during the
 information gathering/enumeration phase of infrastructure
 security assessments. During the enumeration stage, the
 security consultant would typically discover the target
 company's IP netblocks, domain names, phone numbers, etc.
 .
 Subdomain brute-forcing is another technique that should be
 used in the enumeration stage, as it's especially useful
 when other domain enumeration techniques such as zone
 transfers don't work (I rarely see zone transfers being
 publicly allowed these days by the way).

 feed). Older Macs used just CR, while UNIX uses just LF. While most
 modern editors can read all these formats, there may still be a need
 to convert files between them.

Description: Collaboration tools for penetration testing
 Dradis is a tool to help in the process of penetration testing. Penetration
 testing is about information:
 .
  1. Information discovery
  2. Exploit useful information
  3. Report the findings
 .
 But penetration testing is also about sharing the information you and your
 teammates gather. Not sharing the information available in an effective way
 will result in exploitation oportunities lost and the overlapping of efforts.

Description: Library and utilities designed to disable fsync and friends
 This package contains a small LD_PRELOAD library (libeatmydata) and a couple
 of helper utilities designed to transparently disable fsync and friends (like
 open(O_SYNC)). This has two side-effects: making software that writes data
 safely to disk a lot quicker and making this software no longer crash safe.
 .
 You will find eatmydata useful if particular software calls fsync(), sync()
 etc. frequently but the data it stores is not that valuable to you and you may
 afford losing it in case of system crash. Data-to-disk synchronization calls
 are typically very slow on modern file systems and their extensive usage might
 slow down software significantly. It does not make sense to accept such a hit
 in performance if data being manipulated is not very important.
 .
 On the other hand, do not use eatmydata when you care about what software
 stores or it manipulates important components of your system. The library is
 called libEAT-MY-DATA for a reason.

 eSpeak produces good quality English speech. It uses a different synthesis
 method from other open source text to speech (TTS) engines, and sounds quite
 different. It's perhaps not as natural or "smooth", but some find the
 articulation clearer and easier to listen to for long periods.
 .
 It can run as a command line program to speak text from a file or from stdin.
 .
   * Includes different Voices, whose characteristics can be altered.
   * Can produce speech output as a WAV file.
   * Can translate text to phoneme codes, so it could be adapted as a front end
     for another speech synthesis engine.
   * Potential for other languages. More than 40 languages are included.
   * Compact size. The program and its data total about 350 kbytes.
   * Written in C++.

Description: Multipurpose sniffer/interceptor/logger for switched LAN
 Ettercap supports active and passive dissection of many protocols
 (even encrypted ones) and includes many feature for network and host
 analysis.
 .
 Data injection in an established connection and filtering (substitute
 or drop a packet) on the fly is also possible, keeping the connection
 synchronized.
 .
 Many sniffing modes are implemented, for a powerful and complete
 sniffing suite. It is possible to sniff in four modes: IP Based, MAC Based,
 ARP Based (full-duplex) and PublicARP Based (half-duplex).
 .
 Ettercap also has the ability to detect a switched LAN, and to use OS
 fingerprints (active or passive) to find the geometry of the LAN.
 .
 This package contains the Common support files, configuration files,
 plugins, and documentation.  You must also install either
 ettercap-graphical or ettercap-text-only for the actual GUI-enabled
 or text-only ettercap executable, respectively.

Description: support files for all Exim MTA (v4) packages
 Exim (v4) is a mail transport agent. exim4-base provides the support
 files needed by all exim4 daemon packages. You need an additional package
 containing the main executable. The available packages are:
 .
  exim4-daemon-light
  exim4-daemon-heavy
 .
 If you build exim4 from the source package locally, you can also
 build an exim4-daemon-custom package tailored to your own feature set.
 .
 The Debian exim4 packages have their own web page,
 http://wiki.debian.org/PkgExim4. There is also a Debian-specific
 FAQ list. Information about the way the Debian packages are
 configured can be found in
 /usr/share/doc/exim4-base/README.Debian.gz, which additionally contains
 information about the way the Debian binary packages are built. The
 very extensive upstream documentation is shipped in
 /usr/share/doc/exim4-base/spec.txt.gz. To repeat the debconf-driven
 configuration process in a standard setup, invoke dpkg-reconfigure
 exim4-config. There is a Debian-centered mailing list,

 questions there, and only write to the upstream exim-users mailing
 list if you are sure that your question is not Debian-specific. You

Description: configuration for the Exim MTA (v4)
 Exim (v4) is a mail transport agent. exim4-config provides the configuration
 for the exim4 daemon packages. The configuration framework has been split
 off the main package to allow sites to replace the configuration scheme
 with their own without having to change the actual exim4 packages.
 .
 Sites with special configuration needs (having a lot of identically
 configured machines for example) can use this to distribute their own
 custom configuration via the packaging system, using the magic
 available with dpkg's conffile handling, without having to do local
 changes on all of these machines.
 .
 The Debian exim4 packages have their own web page,
 http://wiki.debian.org/PkgExim4. There is also a Debian-specific
 FAQ list. Information about the way the Debian packages are
 configured can be found in
 /usr/share/doc/exim4-base/README.Debian.gz, which additionally contains

 (unless the -nopattern switch is used). No exploitation is

 with the -connect switch). Fierce is a reconnaissance tool.

Description: Free Lossless Audio Codec - command line tools
 FLAC stands for Free Lossless Audio Codec. Grossly oversimplified, FLAC is
 similar to MP3, but lossless.  The FLAC project consists of:
 .
  * The stream format
  * libFLAC, which implements a reference encoder, stream decoder, and file
    decoder
  * flac, which is a command-line wrapper around libFLAC to encode and decode
    .flac files
  * Input plugins for various music players (Winamp, XMMS, and more in the
    works)
 .
 This package contains the command-line tools flac (used for encoding and
 decoding FLACs) and metaflac (used for manipulating FLAC metadata.)

Description: assembler and disassembler for Flash (SWF) bytecode
 Flasm disassembles your entire SWF including all the timelines and
 events. Looking at disassembly, you learn how the Flash compiler works.
 You can also do some optimization on the disassembled code by hand or
 adjust the code as you wish. Flasm can then re-assemble the bytecode
 into a new SWF.
 .
 It is also possible to embed Flasm actions in your ActionScript, making
 optimization of large projects more comfortable.
 .
 Flasm is not a decompiler. What you get is the human readable
 representation of SWF bytecode, not ActionScript source.
 .
 Flasm can also compress and decompress SWF files.
 .
 Flasm does not and may never work with Flash 9 files since Flash 9 is
 a new virtual machine and support for it would mean a full rewrite.

Description: fast lexical analyzer generator
 Flex is a tool for generating scanners: programs which recognized lexical
 patterns in text. It reads the given input files for a description of a
 scanner to generate. The description is in the form of pairs of regular
 expressions and C code, called rules. Flex generates as output a C source
 file, lex.yy.c, which defines a routine yylex().  This file is compiled
 and linked with the -lfl library to produce an executable. When the

Description: generic font configuration library - support binaries
 Fontconfig is a font configuration and customization library, which
 does not depend on the X Window System. It is designed to locate
 fonts within the system and select them according to requirements
 specified by applications.
 .
 Fontconfig is not a rasterization library, nor does it impose a
 particular rasterization library on the application. The X-specific
 library 'Xft' uses fontconfig along with freetype to specify and
 rasterize fonts.
 .
 This package contains a program to maintain the fontconfig cache
 (fc-cache), a sample program to list installed fonts (fc-list), a program
 to test the matching rules (fc-match) and a program to dump the binary
 cache files in string form (fc-cat). It no longer makes fonts managed by defoma
 available to fontconfig applications.

Description: Typeface designed for source code
 No frills. No gimmicks. Hack is hand groomed and optically balanced to be a
 workhorse face for code.
 .
 It has deep roots in the libre, open source typeface community and expands upon
 the contributions of the Bitstream Vera & DejaVu projects. The face has been
 re-designed with a larger glyph set, modifications of the original glyph shapes
 (including distinct point styles and semi-bold punctuation weight in the
 regular set to make analphabetic characters less transparent), and meticulous
 attention to metrics (including numerous spacing adjustments to improve the
 rhythm of the face and the legibility of code at small text sizes). The large
 x-height + wide aperture + low contrast design combined with PostScript
 hinting/hint replacement programs and a TrueType instruction set make it highly
 legible at commonly used source code text sizes with a sweet spot that runs in
 the 8px - 12px range on modern desktop and laptop monitors.
 .
 This package contains the TrueType fonts and the Webfont (WOFF/WOFF2) versions.

 The Latin Modern fonts, also known as "lm fonts", are a set of
 scalable fonts in PostScript Type 1 and OpenType formats. They are
 based on the PostScript Type 1 version of the Computer Modern fonts
 and contain many additional characters (mostly accented ones).
 .
 This package provides the OpenType variant of these fonts. For support
 for TeX and Type 1 (PostScript) fonts, see the lmodern package.
 .
 The Latin Modern fonts were generated using MetaType1, a program
 based on MetaPost for generating PostScript Type 1 fonts
 (ftp://bop.eps.gda.pl/pub/metatype1/). Their size is reasonable and
 they are usually considered to be of good quality (compared to
 cm-super, for instance; however, cm-super contains font families
 that have no equivalent in this package; additionally, there are
 character sets that are supported by cm-super and not by the Latin
 Modern fonts).

Description: OpenGL Utility Toolkit
 GLUT is a window system independent toolkit for writing OpenGL programs,
 implementing a simple windowing API, which makes learning about and
 exploring OpenGL programming very easy.
 .
 GLUT is designed for constructing small to medium sized OpenGL programs,
 however it is not a full-featured toolkit, so large applications requiring
 sophisticated user interfaces are better off using native window system
 toolkits like GTK+ or Motif.

Description: Extensions to extend functionality of GNOME Shell
 The GNOME Shell redefines user interactions with the GNOME desktop. In
 particular, it offers new paradigms for launching applications,
 accessing documents, and organizing open windows in GNOME. Later, it
 will introduce a new applets eco-system and offer new solutions for
 other desktop features, such as notifications and contacts management.
 The GNOME Shell is intended to replace functions handled by the GNOME
 Panel and by the window manager in previous versions of GNOME. The GNOME
 Shell has rich visual effects enabled by new graphical technologies.
 .
 GNOME Shell is extensible using extensions. This package contains
 official GNOME Shell extensions.

 GnuPG is GNU's tool for secure communication and data storage.
 .
 gpgv is actually a stripped-down version of gpg which is only able
 to check signatures. It is somewhat smaller than the fully-blown gpg
 and uses a different (and simpler) way to check that the public keys
 used to make the signature are valid. There are no configuration
 files and only a few options are implemented.

Description: rich set of graph drawing tools
 Graph drawing addresses the problem of visualizing structural information
 by constructing geometric representations of abstract graphs and networks.
 Automatic generation of graph drawings has important applications in key
 technologies such as database design, software engineering, VLSI and
 network design and visual interfaces in other domains. Situations where
 these tools might be particularly useful include:
 .
   * you would like to restructure a program and first need to understand
     the relationships between its types, procedures, and source files
   * you need to find the bottlenecks in an Internet backbone - not only
     individual links, but their relationships
   * you're debugging a protocol or microarchitecture represented as a
     finite state machine and need to figure out how a certain
     error state arises
   * you would like to browse a database schema, knowledge base, or
     distributed program represented graphically
   * you would like to see an overview of a collection of linked documents
   * you would like to discover patterns and communities of interest in a
     database of telephone calls or e-mail messages
 .
 This package contains the command-line tools.

Description: GNU grep, egrep and fgrep
 'grep' is a utility to search for text in files; it can be used from the
 command line or in scripts.  Even if you don't want to use it, other packages
 on your system probably will.
 .
 The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west".
 GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
 twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
 will run more slowly, however.)

 .
  - Scripting in grub.cfg using BASH-like syntax.
  - Support for modern partition maps such as GPT.
  - Modular generation of grub.cfg via update-grub.  Packages providing GRUB
    add-ons can plug in their own script rules and trigger updates by invoking
    update-grub.
  - VESA-based graphical mode with background image support and complete 24-bit
    color set.
  - Support for extended charsets.  Users can write UTF-8 text to their menu
    entries.
 .
 This is a dependency package for a version of GRUB that has been built for
 use with the traditional PC/BIOS architecture.  Installing this package
 indicates that this version of GRUB should be the active boot loader.

Description: GStreamer plugins from the "bad" set
 GStreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs of filters
 which operate on media data.  Applications using this library can do
 anything from real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just
 about anything else media-related.  Its plugin-based architecture means
 that new data types or processing capabilities can be added simply by
 installing new plug-ins.
 .
 GStreamer Bad Plug-ins is a set of plug-ins that aren't up to par compared
 to the rest. They might be close to being good quality, but they're missing
 something - be it a good code review, some documentation, a set of tests, a
 real live maintainer, or some actual wide use.

Description: GStreamer plugins from the "good" set
 GStreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs of filters
 which operate on media data.  Applications using this library can do
 anything from real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just
 about anything else media-related.  Its plugin-based architecture means
 that new data types or processing capabilities can be added simply by
 installing new plug-ins.
 .
 This package contains the GStreamer plugins from the "good" set, a set
 of good-quality plug-ins under the LGPL license.

 gtk-update-icon-cache creates mmap()able cache files for icon themes.
 .
 GTK can use the cache files created by gtk-update-icon-cache to avoid a lot
 of system call and disk seek overhead when the application starts. Since the
 format of the cache files allows them to be mmap()ed shared between multiple
 applications, the overall memory consumption is reduced as well.

 Gtkdialog is a small utility for fast and easy GUI building. It can be used to
 create dialog boxes for almost any interpreted and compiled programs which is
 a very attractive feature since the developer does not have to learn various
 GUI languages for the miscellaneous programming languages.
 .
 The Gtkdialog utility uses the Glade Library to load, parse and execute Glade
 files. Gtkdialog makes the use of Glade created user interfaces convenient in
 a shell script or any other interpreted language.
 .
 Stand-alone, bash, and awk examples are provided.

Description: Hierarchical view of the machine - utilities
 Hardware Locality (hwloc) provides a portable abstraction (across OS, versions,
 architectures, ...) of the hierarchical topology of modern architectures. It
 primarily aims at helping high-performance computing applications with
 gathering information about the hardware so as to exploit it accordingly and
 efficiently.
 .
 hwloc provides a hierarchical view of the machine, NUMA memory nodes,
 sockets, shared caches, cores and simultaneous multithreading. It also gathers
 various attributes such as cache and memory information.
 .
 hwloc supports old kernels not having sysfs topology information,
 with knowledge of cpusets, offline cpus, and Kerrighed support
 .
 This package contains utilities to show the topology of the machine (lstopo and
 hwloc-ls), manipulate cpu masks (hwloc-calc), and bind processes (hwloc-bind).

Description: User space provider drivers for libibverbs
 libibverbs is a library that allows userspace processes to use RDMA
 "verbs" as described in the InfiniBand Architecture Specification and
 the RDMA Protocol Verbs Specification.  iWARP ethernet NICs support
 RDMA over hardware-offloaded TCP/IP, while InfiniBand is a
 high-throughput, low-latency networking technology.  InfiniBand host
 channel adapters (HCAs) and iWARP NICs commonly support direct
 hardware access from userspace (kernel bypass), and libibverbs
 supports this when available.
 .
 A RDMA driver consists of a kernel portion and a user space portion.
 This package contains the user space verbs drivers:

Description: configure network interfaces for parallel routing (bonding)
 This is a tool to attach and detach slave network interfaces to a bonding
 device. A bonding device will act like a normal Ethernet network device to
 the kernel, but will send out the packets via the slave devices using a simple
 round-robin scheduler. This allows for simple load-balancing, identical to
 "channel bonding" or "trunking" techniques used in switches.
 .
 The kernel must have support for bonding devices for ifenslave to be useful.
 This package supports 2.6.x kernels and the recent 3.x.x kernels.

Description: IIO sensors to D-Bus proxy
 Industrial I/O subsystem is intended to provide support for devices
 that in some sense are analog to digital or digital to analog convertors
 .
 Devices that fall into this category are:
  * ADCs
  * Accelerometers
  * Gyros
  * IMUs
  * Capacitance to Digital Converters (CDCs)
  * Pressure Sensors
  * Color, Light and Proximity Sensors
  * Temperature Sensors
  * Magnetometers
  * DACs
  * DDS (Direct Digital Synthesis)
  * PLLs (Phase Locked Loops)
  * Variable/Programmable Gain Amplifiers (VGA, PGA)
 .
 Many ultrabooks ship with some of these devices. iio-sensor-proxy is
 intended to serve as a proxy, providing access to these devices through
 a D-Bus interface

Description: discover and fingerprint IKE hosts (IPsec VPN Servers)
 ike-scan discovers IKE hosts and can also fingerprint them using the
 retransmission backoff pattern.
 .
 ike-scan does two things:
 .
 a) Discovery: Determine which hosts are running IKE.
    This is done by displaying those hosts which respond to the IKE requests
    sent by ike-scan.
    .
 b) Fingerprinting: Determine which IKE implementation the hosts are using.
    This is done by recording the times of the IKE response packets from the
    target hosts and comparing the observed retransmission backoff pattern
    against known patterns.
    .
    The retransmission backoff fingerprinting concept is discussed in more
    detail in the UDP backoff fingerprinting paper which should be included
    in the ike-scan kit as udp-backoff-fingerprinting-paper.txt.

Description: Configuration controlling privilege escalation to root
 Penetration tester often use applications that require root privileges
 to perform their work. The default configuration requires the user to
 input his password to be granted root rights.
 .
 With this package installed, you can simply add the user to the
 "kali-trusted" group and it will automatically benefit from
 password-less privilege escalation. This is a convenience feature
 but also a security risk, use with caution and make sure that you
 don't leave your computer unattented!
 .
 You can quickly enable/disable this feature with "dpkg-reconfigure
 kali-grant-root". It will populate the "kali-trusted" groups with all the
 members of the "sudo" group.

 Note that only the LCSidx function is optimized in XS at the moment, which
 means only compact_diff will get significantly faster for large data sets,
 while diff and sdiff will run in identical speed as Algorithm::Diff.

Description: Multi-format archive and compression library (shared library)
 The libarchive library provides a flexible interface for reading and writing
 archives in various formats such as tar and cpio. libarchive also supports
 reading and writing archives compressed using various compression filters such
 as gzip and bzip2. The library is inherently stream-oriented; readers serially
 iterate through the archive, writers serially add things to the archive.
 .
 Archive formats supported are:
 .
    * tar (read and write, including GNU extensions)
    * pax (read and write, including GNU and star extensions)
    * cpio (read and write, including odc and newc variants)
    * iso9660 (read and write, including Joliet and Rockridge extensions, with
      some limitations)

    * shar (write only)
    * ar (read and write, including BSD and GNU/SysV variants)
    * empty (read only; in particular, note that no other format will accept an
      empty file)
    * raw (read only)
    * xar (read only)
    * rar (read only, with some limitations)
    * 7zip (read and write, with some limitations)
 .
 Filters supported are:
 .
    * gzip (read and write, uses zlib)
    * bzip2 (read and write, uses bzlib)
    * compress (read and write, uses an internal implementation)
    * uudecode (read only)
    * separate command-line compressors with fixed-signature auto-detection

Description: memory-hard hashing function - runtime library
 Argon2 is a password-hashing function that can be used to hash passwords
 for credential storage, key derivation, or other applications.
 .
 There are two main versions of Argon2: Argon2i and Argon2d.
 Argon2i is the safest against side-channel attacks, while Argon2d provides
 the highest resistance against GPU cracking attacks.
 .
 Argon2i and Argon2d are parametrized by:
  * A time cost, which defines the amount of computation realized and
    therefore the execution time, given in number of iterations
  * A memory cost, which defines the memory usage, given in kibibytes
  * A parallelism degree, which defines the number of parallel threads
 .
 This package includes the dynamic library against which programs are linked.

 FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode,
 mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and
 machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the
 cutting edge.
 .
 This library provides a generic encoding/decoding framework and
 contains multiple decoders and encoders for audio, video and subtitle streams,
 and several bitstream filters.
 .
 The shared architecture provides various services ranging from bit stream I/O
 to DSP optimizations, and makes it suitable for implementing robust and fast
 codecs as well as for experimentation.
 .
 This package contains the runtime files.

Description: Library for manipulating block devices
 libblockdev is a C library with GObject introspection support that can be used
 for doing low-level operations with block devices like setting up LVM, BTRFS,
 LUKS or MD RAID.
 .
 The library uses plugins (LVM, BTRFS,...) and serves as a thin wrapper around
 its plugins' functionality. All the plugins, however, can be used as
 standalone libraries. One of the core principles of libblockdev is that it is
 stateless from the storage configuration's perspective (e.g. it has no
 information about VGs when creating an LV).

Description: atomic data types, operations, and memory ordering constraints
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 Boost.Atomic is a library that provides atomic data types and
 operations on these data types, as well as memory ordering
 constraints required for coordinating multiple threads through atomic
 variables. It implements the interface as defined by the C++11
 standard, but makes this feature available for platforms lacking
 system/compiler support for this particular C++11 feature.
 .
 Users of this library should already be familiar with concurrency in
 general, as well as elementary concepts such as "mutual exclusion".
 .
 The implementation makes use of processor-specific instructions where
 possible (via inline assembler, platform libraries or compiler
 intrinsics), and falls back to "emulating" atomic operations through
 locking.

Description: C++ representation of time duration, time point, and clocks
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 The Boost.Chrono library provides:
 .
  * A means to represent time durations: managed by the generic duration
    class.Examples of time durations include days, minutes, seconds and
    nanoseconds, which can be represented with a fixed number of clock
    ticks per unit. All of these units of time duration are united with
    a generic interface by the duration facility.
  * A type for representing points in time: time_point. A time_point
    represents an epoch plus or minus a duration. The library leaves
    epochs unspecified. A time_point is associated with a clock.
  * Several clocks, some of which may not be available on a particular
    platform: system_clock, steady_clock and high_resolution_clock. A
    clock is a pairing of a time_point and duration, and a function
    which returns a time_point representing now.
 .
 To make the timing facilities more generally useful, Boost.Chrono
 provides a number of clocks that are thin wrappers around the
 operating system's time APIs, thereby allowing the extraction of wall
 clock time, user CPU time, system CPU time spent by the process:
 .
  * process_real_cpu_clock, captures wall clock CPU time spent by the
    current process.
  * process_user_cpu_clock, captures user-CPU time spent by the current
    process.
  * process_system_cpu_clock, captures system-CPU time spent by the
    current process.
  * a tuple-like class process_cpu_clock, that captures real, user-CPU,
    and system-CPU process times together.
  * a thread_clock thread steady clock giving the time spent by the
    current thread (when supported by a platform).
 .
 Lastly, Boost.Chrono includes typeof registration for duration and
 time_point to permit using emulated auto with C++03 compilers.

 .
 The Boost Python Library is used to quickly and easily export a C++
 library to Python such that the Python interface is very similar to
 the C++ interface. It is designed to be minimally intrusive on your
 C++ design. In most cases, you should not have to alter your C++
 classes in any way in order to use them with Boost.Python.  The
 system should simply "reflect" your C++ classes and functions into
 Python. The major features of Boost.Python include support for:
 Subclassing extension types in Python, Overriding virtual functions
 in Python, Member function Overloading, Automatic wrapping of
 numeric operators among others.
 .
 One of the python interpreter packages is required to use the
 created extensions.

Description: regular expression library for C++
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 Regular expressions are a form of pattern-matching that are often
 used in text processing; many users will be familiar with the Unix
 utilities grep, sed and awk, and the programming language perl, each
 of which make extensive use of regular expressions. Traditionally C++
 users have been limited to the POSIX C APIs for manipulating regular
 expressions, and while regex does provide these APIs, they do not
 represent the best way to use the library. For example regex can cope
 with wide character strings, or search and replace operations (in a
 manner analogous to either sed or perl), something that traditional C
 libraries can not do.

 error_condition objects. Because error_code objects can represent
 errors from sources other than the operating system, including
 user-defined sources, each error_code and error_condition has an
 associated error_category.

 The Bauer stereophonic-to-binaural DSP (bs2b) is designed to improve

 .
 Typical stereo recordings are made for listening with speakers.
 What's missing in headphones is the sound going from each channel
 to the opposite ear, arriving a short time later for the extra distance
 traveled, and with a bit of high frequency roll-off for the shadowing
 effect of the head. The time delay to the far ear should also be
 somewhat longer at low frequencies than at high frequencies. bs2b
 implements both of these ideas to transform stereophonic recordings
 for headphone listening.

Description: Perl extension to generate cryptographically-secure random bytes
 Bytes::Random::Secure provides two interfaces for obtaining crypt-quality
 random bytes. The simple interface is built around plain functions. For
 greater control over the Random Number Generator's seeding, there is an
 Object Oriented interface that provides much more flexibility.
 .
 The "functions" interface provides five functions that can be used any time
 you need a string (or MIME Base64 representation, or hex-digits
 representation, or Quoted Printable representation) of a specific number of
 random bytes. There are equivalent methods available via the OO interface.
 .
 Bytes::Random::Secure can be a drop-in replacement for Bytes::Random, with
 the primary enhancement of using a much higher quality random number
 generator to create the random data. The random_bytes function emulates the
 user interface of Bytes::Random's function by the same name. But with
 Bytes::Random::Secure the random number generator comes from
 Math::Random::ISAAC, and is suitable for cryptographic purposes. The harder
 problem to solve is how to seed the generator. This module uses
 Crypt::Random::Seed to generate the initial seeds for Math::Random::ISAAC.

Description: Perl interface to the Cairo graphics library
 libcairo-perl provides access to the Cairo library.
 .
 Cairo is a 2D graphics library with support for multiple
 output devices. It is designed to produce consistent output
 on all output media while taking advantage of display hardware
 acceleration when available (eg. through the X Render Extension).
 .
 The cairo API provides operations similar to the drawing
 operators of PostScript and PDF. Operations in cairo including
 stroking and filling cubic Bézier splines, transforming and compositing
 translucent images, and antialiased text rendering. All drawing
 operations can be transformed by any affine transformation (scale,
 rotation, shear, etc.)
 .

Description: Cairo 2D vector graphics library
 Cairo is a multi-platform library providing anti-aliased

 optional translucence (opacity/alpha) and combined using the
 extended Porter/Duff compositing algebra as found in the X Render
 Extension.

 Cairo exports a stateful rendering API similar in spirit to the path
 construction, text, and painting operators of PostScript, (with the
 significant addition of translucence in the imaging model). When
 complete, the API is intended to support the complete imaging model of
 PDF 1.4.

Description: Perl module that automatically generates accessors
 Class::Accessor automagically generates accessor/mutator methods for your
 class. Most of the time, writing accessors is an exercise in cutting and
 pasting. If you make your module a subclass of Class::Accessor and declare
 your accessor fields with mk_accessors() then you will find yourself with a
 set of automatically generated accessors which can even be customized.

 Class::C3 is a Perl pragma that modifies the standard method resolution order

 order.
 .
 The C3 algorithm aims to provide a sane method resolution order with multiple
 inheritance. It was first introduced in the Dylan language, later adopted for
 Python 2.3. It is also the canonical MRO implementation for Perl 6 classes
 and is the default for Parrot objects as well.

 "require EXPR" only accepts Class/Name.pm style module names, not
 Class::Name. For that, Class::Load provides "load_class 'Class::Name'".
 .
 It's often useful to test whether a module can be loaded, instead of throwing
 an error when it's not available. For that, Class::Load provides
 "try_load_class 'Class::Name'".
 .
 Finally, sometimes it is important to know whether a particular class has
 been loaded. Asking %INC is an option, but that will miss inner packages and
 any class for which the filename does not correspond to the package name. For
 that, this module provides "is_class_loaded 'Class::Name'".

 Class::XSAccessor implements fast XS accessors both for getting at and setting
 an object attribute. Additionally, the module supports mutators and simple
 predicates like those for testing the truth value of a variable. It works only
 with objects that are implemented as ordinary hashes.
 .
 The XS accessor methods were between 1.6 and 2.5 times faster than typical
 pure-perl accessors in some simple benchmarking. If you usually write clear
 code, a factor of two speed-up is a good estimate.
 .
 Refer to Class::XSAccessor::Array (also included in libclass-xsaccessor-perl)
 for an implementation that works with array-based objects.

Description: Apache Commons Lang utility classes
 Apache Commons Lang is a package of Java utility classes for the classes
 that are in java.lang's hierarchy, or are considered to be so standard
 as to justify existence in java.lang.
 .
 The standard Java libraries fail to provide enough methods for manipulation
 of its core classes. Apache Commons Lang provides these extra methods.
 .
 Apache Commons Lang provides a host of helper utilities for the java.lang API,
 notably String manipulation methods, basic numerical methods, object
 reflection, concurrency, creation and serialization and System properties.
 Additionally it contains basic enhancements to java.util.Date and a series
 of utilities dedicated to help with building methods, such as hashCode,
 toString and equals.

 The Crypt::SSLeay package contains Net::SSL, which is automatically
 loaded by LWP::Protocol::https on HTTPS requests, and provides the
 necessary SSL glue for that module to work via these deprecated modules:
 Crypt::SSLeay::CTX, Crypt::SSLeay::Conn and Crypt::SSLeay::X509.
 .
 Work on Crypt::SSLeay has been continued only to provide HTTPS support
 for the LWP - libwww perl libraries. If you want access to the OpenSSL
 API via perl, check out Sampo's Net::SSLeay (available in Debian as
 the libnet-ssleay-perl package).

 operation easily, though not necessarily quickly. There are other modules
 that can do a small subset of these operations quicker, so if speed is a

Description: Perl5 database interface to the MariaDB/MySQL database
 DBD::mysql is the Perl5 Database Interface driver for the MariaDB/MySQL
 database. In other words: DBD::mysql is an interface between the Perl
 programming language and the MySQL programming API that comes with the
 MariaDB/MySQL relational database management system. Most functions provided by
 this programming API are supported. Some rarely used functions are
 missing, mainly because no one ever requested them. However supported
 features include: compression of data between server and client; timeouts;
 SSL; prepared statement support; server administration such as creating
 and dropping databases and restarting the server; auto-reconnection;
 utf8; bind type guessing; bind comment placeholders; automated insert ids;
 transactions; multiple result sets and multithreading.

Description: Perl DBI driver with a self-contained RDBMS
 DBD::SQLite is a Perl DBI driver with a self-contained relational database
 management system. It embeds a small and fast embedded SQL database engine
 called SQLite (see sqlite3) into a DBI driver. It is useful if you want a
 relational database for your project, but don't want to install a large
 RDBMS system like MySQL or PostgreSQL.
 .
 SQLite supports the following features:
 .
  * Implements a large subset of SQL92 (<URL:http://www.sqlite.org/lang.html>)
  * A complete DB in a single disk file
    Everything for your database is stored in a single disk file, making it
    easier to move things around than with DBD::CSV.
  * Atomic commit and rollback
 .
 The engine is very fast, but for updates/inserts/dml it does perform a global
 lock on the entire database. This, obviously, might not be good for multiple
 user systems. The database also appears to be significantly faster if your
 transactions are coarse.

 Devel::CallChecker makes some new features of the Perl 5.14.0 C API

 The features are centred around the function cv_set_call_checker,
 which allows XS code to attach a magical annotation
 to a Perl subroutine,
 resulting in resolvable calls to that subroutine
 being mutated at compile time by arbitrary C code.
 This module makes cv_set_call_checker
 and several supporting functions available.
 (It is possible to achieve the effect of cv_set_call_checker
 from XS code on much earlier Perl versions,
 but it is painful to achieve without the centralised facility.)

Description: perl module to create bubble-babble fingerprints
 Digest::BubbleBabble takes a message digest (generated by
 either of the MD5 or SHA-1 message digest algorithms) and creates
 a fingerprint of that digest in "bubble babble" format.
 Bubble babble is a method of representing a message digest
 as a string of "real" words, to make the fingerprint easier
 to remember. The "words" are not necessarily real words, but
 they look more like words than a string of hex characters.
 .
 Bubble babble fingerprinting is used by the SSH2 suite
 (and, consequently, by Net::SSH::Perl, the Perl SSH
 implementation) to display easy-to-remember key fingerprints.
 The key (a DSA or RSA key) is converted into a textual form,
 digested using Digest::SHA, and run through bubblebabble
 to create the key fingerprint.

Description: module for declaring version conflicts for a distribution
 One shortcoming of the CPAN clients that currently exist is that they have no
 way of specifying conflicting downstream dependencies of modules.
 Dist::CheckConflicts attempts to work around this issue by allowing you to
 specify conflicting versions of modules separately, and deal with them after
 the module is done installing.
 .
 For instance, say you have a module Foo, and some other module Bar uses Foo.
 If Foo were to change its API in a non-backwards-compatible way, this would
 cause Bar to break until it is updated to use the new API. Foo can't just
 depend on the fixed version of Bar, because this will cause a circular
 dependency (because Bar is already depending on Foo), and this doesn't
 express intent properly anyway - Foo doesn't use Bar at all. The ideal
 solution would be for there to be a way to specify conflicting versions of
 modules in a way that would let CPAN clients update conflicting modules
 automatically after an existing module is upgraded, but until that happens,
 this module will allow users to do this manually.

Description: implementation of the EBU R128 loudness standard
 The European Broadcasting Union Loudness Recommendation (EBU R128) informs
 broadcasters how they can analyze and normalize audio so that each piece of
 audio sounds roughly the same volume to the human ear.
 .
 This C library provides an API which analyzes audio and outputs perceived
 loudness. The results can then be used to normalize volume during playback.
 This is an alternative to ReplayGain.
 .
 Features:
  * Implements M, S and I modes
  * Implements loudness range measurement (EBU - TECH 3342)
  * True peak scanning
  * Supports all samplerates by recalculation of the filter coefficients
 .
 This package contains the shared library.

Description: Eclipse Java Development Tools Core
 Eclipse JDT Core is the Java infrastructure of the Eclipse Java IDE.
 It includes:
  * An incremental Java compiler. Implemented as an Eclipse builder, it is based
    on technology evolved from VisualAge for Java compiler. In particular, it
    allows one to run and debug code which still contains unresolved errors.
  * A Java Model that provides API for navigating the Java element tree.
    The Java element tree defines a Java centric view of a project. It surfaces
    elements like package fragments, compilation units, binary classes, types,
    methods, fields.
  * A Java Document Model providing API for manipulating a structured Java
    source document.
  * Code assist and code select support.
  * An indexed based search infrastructure that is used for searching, code
    assist, type hierarchy computation, and refactoring. The Java search engine
    can accurately find precise matches either in sources or binaries.
  * Evaluation support either in a scrapbook page or a debugger context.
  * Source code formatter

Description: utility to determine the locale encoding
 In many applications it's wise to let Perl use Unicode for the strings it
 processes. Most of the interfaces Perl has to the outside world are still byte
 based. Programs therefore need to decode byte strings that enter the program
 from the outside and encode them again on the way out.
 .
 The POSIX locale system is used to specify both the language conventions
 requested by the user and the preferred character set to consume and output.
 The Encode::Locale module looks up the charset and encoding (called a CODESET
 in the locale jargon) and arranges for the Encode module to know this encoding
 under the name "locale". It means bytes obtained from the environment can be
 converted to Unicode strings by calling Encode::encode(locale => $bytes) and
 converted back again with Encode::decode(locale => $string).

Description: Perl module for error/exception handling in an OO-ish way
 The Error module provides two interfaces.  Firstly "Error" provides a
 procedural interface to exception handling. Secondly "Error" is a base class
 for errors/exceptions that can either be thrown, for subsequent catch, or can
 simply be recorded.
 .
 Errors in the class "Error" should not be thrown directly, but the user
 should throw errors from a sub-class of "Error".
 .
 Warning: Using the "Error" module is no longer recommended due to the
 black-magical nature of its syntactic sugar, which often tends to break. Its
 maintainers have stopped actively writing code that uses it, and discourage
 people from doing so.
 .
 Recommended alternatives are Exception::Class (libexception-class-perl),
 Error::Exception (not packaged), TryCatch (libtrycatch-perl), and Try::Tiny
 (libtry-tiny-perl).

Description: Perl module to safely and cleanly create closures via string eval
 String eval is often used for dynamic code generation. For instance, Moose
 uses it heavily, to generate inlined versions of accessors and constructors,
 which speeds code up at runtime by a significant amount. String eval is not
 without its issues however - it's difficult to control the scope it's used in
 (which determines which variables are in scope inside the eval), and it can
 be quite slow, especially if doing a large number of evals.
 .
 Eval::Closure attempts to solve both of those problems. It provides an
 eval_closure function, which evals a string in a clean environment, other
 than a fixed list of specified variables. It also caches the result of the
 eval, so that doing repeated evals of the same source, even with a different
 environment, will be much faster (but note that the description is part of
 the string to be evaled, so it must also be the same (or non-existent) if
 caching is to work properly).

Description: Frame Streams (fstrm) library
 Frame Streams is a light weight, binary clean protocol that allows for the
 transport of arbitrarily encoded data payload sequences with minimal framing
 overhead -- just four bytes per data frame. Frame Streams does not specify an
 encoding format for data frames and can be used with any data serialization
 format that produces byte sequences, such as Protocol Buffers, XML, JSON,
 MessagePack, YAML, etc. Frame Streams can be used as both a streaming
 transport over a reliable byte stream socket (TCP sockets, TLS connections,
 AF_UNIX sockets, etc.) for data in motion as well as a file format for data
 at rest. A "Content Type" header identifies the type of payload being carried
 over an individual Frame Stream and allows cooperating programs to determine
 how to interpret a given sequence of data payloads.
 .
 This is the "fstrm" implementation of Frame Streams in C.

Description: conservative garbage collector for C and C++
 Boehm-Demers-Weiser's GC is a garbage collecting storage allocator that is
 intended to be used as a plug-in replacement for C's malloc or C++'s new().
 .
 It allows you to allocate memory basically as you normally would without
 explicitly deallocating memory that is no longer useful. The collector
 automatically recycles memory when it determines that it can no longer be
 used.
 .
 This version of the collector is thread safe, has C++ support and uses the
 defaults for everything else. However, it does not work as a drop-in malloc(3)
 replacement.

Description: GObject based collection and utility library
 libgee is a collection library providing GObject-based interfaces and
 classes for commonly used data structures.
 .
 libgee provides the following interfaces:
  * Traversable
    - Iterable
         + Collection
           # List
             * BidirList
           # Set
             * SortedSet
               - BidirSortedSet
           # MultiSet
           # Queue
             * Deque
         + Map
           # SortedMap
             * BidirSortedMap
    - Iterator
         + BidirIterator
           # BidirListIterator
         + ListIterator
           # BidirListIterator
  * MultiMap
  * Future
 .
 The ArrayList, ArrauQueue, ConcurrentLinkedList, ConcurrentSet, HashSet,
 HashMap, HashMultiSet, HashMultiMap, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, Promise,
 TreeSet, TreeMap, TreeMultiSet, and TreeMultiMap classes provide a
 reasonable sample implementation of those interfaces. In addition, a set of
 abstract classes are provided to ease the implementation of new collections.
 .
 Around that, the API provides means to retrieve read-only views, efficient
 sort algorithms, simple, bi-directional or index-based mutable iterators
 depending on the collection type.
 .
 libgee is written in Vala and can be used like any GObject-based C library.
 It's planned to provide bindings for further languages.
 .
 This package contains the shared libraries.

 contextual shaping, ligatures, reordering, split glyphs, bidirectionality,
 stacking diacritics and complex positioning.
 .
 This library was designed and developed by the NRSI (Non-Roman Script
 Initiative) within SIL International (www.sil.org) to act as a complement to
 other smart font rendering technologies with limited practical local
 extensibility. Its purpose is to help meet the needs of a very large number
 of "minority language" communities for local extensibility of complex script
 behaviors.
 .
 The behavior of the rendering engine for a given writing system is specified
 through extra tables added to a TrueType font.  These tables are generated by
 compiling a GDL (Graphite Description Language) source file into a font using
 grcompiler.

Description: Shared libraries for GSM speech compressor
 This package contains runtime shared libraries for libgsm, an
 implementation of the European GSM 06.10 provisional standard for
 full-rate speech transcoding, prI-ETS 300 036, which uses RPE/LTP
 (residual pulse excitation/long term prediction) coding at 13 kbit/s.
 .
 GSM 06.10 compresses frames of 160 13-bit samples (8 kHz sampling
 rate, i.e. a frame rate of 50 Hz) into 260 bits; for compatibility
 with typical UNIX applications, this implementation turns frames of
 160 16-bit linear samples into 33-byte frames (1650 Bytes/s).
 The quality of the algorithm is good enough for reliable speaker
 recognition; even music often survives transcoding in recognizable
 form (given the bandwidth limitations of 8 kHz sampling rate).
 .
 The interfaces offered are a front end modelled after compress(1), and
 a library API.  Compression and decompression run faster than realtime
 on most SPARCstations.  The implementation has been verified against the
 ETSI standard test patterns.

 GStreamer Bad Plug-ins is a set of plug-ins that aren't up to par compared
 to the rest. They might be close to being good quality, but they're missing
 something - be it a good code review, some documentation, a set of tests, a
 real live maintainer, or some actual wide use.

 Quoting Wikipedia:
 An XPS file is in fact a Unicoded ZIP archive using the Open Packaging
 Conventions, containing the files which make up the document. These include an
 XML markup file for each page, text, embedded fonts, raster images, 2D vector
 graphics, as well as the digital rights management information. The contents
 of an XPS file can be examined simply by opening it in an application which
 supports ZIP files.
 .
 The OpenXPS document format specification supports features such as color
 gradients, transparencies, CMYK color spaces, printer calibration,
 multiple-ink systems and print schemas.
 .
 This package contains the library. It is being used by evince to read XPS
 documents.

Description: collection of modules that parse HTML text documents
 HTML::Parser is a collection of modules useful for handling HTML documents.
 These modules used to be part of the libwww-perl distribution, but are now
 unbundled in order to facilitate a separate development track.
 .
 Objects of the HTML::Parser class will recognize markup and separate it from
 content data. As different kinds of markup are recognized, the corresponding
 event handler is invoked. The document to be parsed may also be supplied in
 arbitrary chunks, making on-the-fly parsing of network documents possible.

Description: module for using HTML templates with Perl
 HTML::Template attempts to make using HTML templates simple and
 natural. It extends standard HTML with the pseudo tags <TMPL_VAR>,
 <TMPL_LOOP>, <TMPL_INCLUDE>, <TMPL_IF> and <TMPL_ELSE>. These are used
 to implement some basic logic - variable substitution, loops,
 conditional branches - inside the HTML template, while leaving the more
 complex computations to separate Perl code. This keeps the template
 accessible for designers and other non-Perl people, without limiting
 the programmer.
 .
 HTML::Template optionally stores its cache in shared memory using the
 IPC::SharedCache module. Please install libipc-sharedcache-perl and
 pass the shared_cache option to HTML::Template if you want to make use
 of this.

Description: HTTP cookie jars
 This class is for objects that represent a "cookie jar" -- that is, a
 database of all the HTTP cookies that a given LWP::UserAgent object knows
 about.
 .
 Cookies are a general mechanism which server side connections can use to both
 store and retrieve information on the client side of the connection. For more
 information about cookies refer to
 <URL:http://curl.haxx.se/rfc/cookie_spec.html> and
 <URL:http://www.cookiecentral.com/>. HTTP::Cookies also implements the new
 style cookies described in RFC 2965. The two variants of cookies are supposed
 to be able to coexist happily.
 .
 Instances of the class HTTP::Cookies are able to store a collection of
 Set-Cookie2: and Set-Cookie: headers and are able to use this information to
 initialize Cookie-headers in HTTP::Request objects. The state of a
 HTTP::Cookies object can be saved in and restored from files.

Description: simple http server class
 Instances of the HTTP::Daemon class are HTTP/1.1 servers that listen on a
 socket for incoming requests. The HTTP::Daemon is a subclass of
 IO::Socket::IP, so you can perform socket operations directly on it too.
 .
 The accept() method will return when a connection from a client is available.
 The returned value will be an HTTP::Daemon::ClientConn object which is
 another IO::Socket::IP subclass. Calling the get_request() method on this
 object will read data from the client and return an HTTP::Request object. The
 ClientConn object also provide methods to send back various responses.
 .
 This HTTP daemon does not fork(2) for you. Your application, i.e. the user of
 the HTTP::Daemon is responsible for forking if that is desirable. Also note
 that the user is responsible for generating responses that conform to the
 HTTP/1.1 protocol.

 LOCK, DELETE and PUT files and much more on a DAV-enabled webserver.
 .
 The PerlDAV library consists of:
 .
  * HTTP::DAV - an object-oriented Web-DAV client API.
  * dave - the DAV Explorer, an end-user Unix console program for
    interacting with WebDAV servers. dave looks and feels like a

 The HTTP::Message distribution contains classes useful for representing the

 requests, responses and the headers contained within them.
 .
 The HTTP::Headers class encapsulates HTTP-style message headers. The headers
 consist of attribute-value pairs also called fields, which may be repeated,
 and which are printed in a particular order. The field names are cases
 insensitive.
 .
 Instances of this class are usually created as member variables of the
 HTTP::Request and HTTP::Response classes, internal to the library.

 transparently provides mmap-ed DMA for efficient data transfer. It also
 represents the third generation of I/O technology for Linux 1394 for
 these media types thereby removing the complexities of additional kernel
 modules, /dev nodes, and procfs. It also consolidates features for plug
 control registers and connection management that previously existed in
 experimental form in an unreleased version of libavc1394.

Description: IJS raster image transport protocol: shared library
 IJS is, first and foremost, a protocol for transmission of raster page
 images. This snapshot provides a reference implementation of the protocol,
 the design of which is still in flux. When the protocol specification is
 published, it will be authoritative. Applications should feel free to link
 against the library provided in this package, adapt that code for their own
 needs, or roll a completely new implementation.
 .
 IJS is a client-server protocol, used to write ghostscript drivers. The
 drivers are separate programs. The client and server communicate via pipes,
 though shared memory may be used additionally in the future. Currently IJS
 is used by the hpijs and ijsgimpprint drivers.
 .
 Code for both the client- and server-side is included in the library. This
 package provides the shared library.

Description: module for importing packages into other packages
 Import::Into creates a global method import::into which you can call on
 any package to import it into another package. This is useful because
 there are many different ways to write exporters: some use Exporter, some
 use Sub::Exporter, some use Moose::Exporter, some use Exporter::Declare
 and some things are pragmas.
 .
 And if you want to re-export other things, you have to know which is which.
 Exporter subclasses provide export_to_level, but if they overrode their
 import method all bets are off. Sub::Exporter provides an into parameter
 but figuring out something used it isn't trivial. Pragmas need to have
 their import method called directly since they affect the current unit of
 compilation. Import::Into can be used to import packages into other packages
 without having to deal with the specific details of every exporting approach.

 .
 The IO::All object is a proxy for IO::File, IO::Dir, IO::Socket, IO::String,
 Tie::File, File::Spec, File::Path and File::ReadBackwards; as well as all the
 DBM and MLDBM modules. You can use most of the methods found in these classes
 and in IO::Handle (which they inherit from). IO::All adds dozens of other
 helpful idiomatic methods including file stat and manipulation functions.

Version: 2.8.29-6
Description: UglifyJS in library form
 UglifyJS is a JavaScript compressor/minifier written in JavaScript. It
 also contains tools that allow one to automate working with JavaScript
 code:
 .
  * A parser which produces an abstract syntax tree (AST) from
    JavaScript code.
  * A code generator which outputs JavaScript code from an AST, also
    providing the option to get a source map.
  * A compressor (optimizer) - it uses the transformer API to optimize
    an AST into a smaller one.
  * A mangler - reduce names of local variables to (usually)
    single-letters.
  * A scope analyzer, which is a tool that augments the AST with
    information about where variables are defined/referenced etc.
  * A tree walker - a simple API allowing you to do something on every
    node in the AST.
  * A tree transformer - another API intended to transform the tree.
 .
 All the above utilities and APIs are defined in ~6500 lines of code
 (except for the effective generation of the source-map, which is
 handled by the source-map module). Compared to alternatives, UglifyJS
 is pretty small.
 .
 This package provides UglifyJS in library form for use by other Javascript
 packages and web applications.
 .

Description: JavaScript's functional programming helper library
 Underscore is a utility-belt library for JavaScript that provides a lot
 of the functional programming support that you would expect in
 Prototype.js (or Ruby), but without extending any of the built-in
 JavaScript objects.  It's the tie to go along with jQuery's tux.
 .
 Underscore provides 60-odd functions that support both the usual
 functional suspects: map, select, invoke - as well as more specialized
 helpers: function binding, javascript templating, deep equality
 testing, and so on.  It delegates to built-in functions, if present, so
 modern browsers will use the native implementations of forEach, map,
 reduce, filter, every, some and indexOf.

Description: C library for creating and accessing dynamic arrays
 Judy is a C library that implements a dynamic array.  Empty Judy arrays are
 declared with null pointers.  A Judy array consumes memory only when
 populated yet can grow to take advantage of all available memory.  Judy's key
 benefits are:  scalability, performance, memory efficiency, and ease of use.
 Judy arrays are designed to grow without tuning into the peta-element range,
 scaling near O(log-base-256).
 .
 Judy arrays are accessed with insert, retrieve, and delete calls for number
 or string indexes.  Configuration and tuning are not required -- in fact not
 possible.  Judy offers sorting, counting, and neighbor/empty searching.
 Indexes can be sequential, clustered, periodic, or random -- it doesn't
 matter to the algorithm.  Judy arrays can be arranged hierarchically to
 handle any bit patterns -- large indexes, sets of keys, etc.
 .
 Judy is often an improvement over common data structures such as:  arrays,
 sparse arrays, hash tables, B-trees, binary trees, linear lists, skiplists,
 other sort and search algorithms, and counting functions.

Description: converts plain array images into multi-size representation
 The LiquidRescale (lqr) library provides a C/C++ API for performing
 non-uniform resizing of images by the seam-carving technique.
 .
 The library takes images in plain array format as input and converts
 them to a multi-size representation.
 .
 Following is a list of features:
 .
   * Areas in the image can be marked for preservation or discard
   * Once the image has been fully processed, the scaling can be done
     in real-time. In fact, the information can be saved and read out
     later without any further processing
   * The resizing is done with a single function which automatically
     performs all the necessary operations; it can also work in
     successive steps without wasting computational time
   * Possibility to tune the carving operation by letting the seams be
     less connected, or more rigid, or both
   * Can export and import the visibility map (the seams)
   * Other images can be attached and undergo the same carving process
     as the parent image
   * The automatic feature detection algorithm can be tuned by
     selecting among different energy gradient functions
   * Reports progress through a customizable interface
   * A signalling system permits one to cleanly handle errors
 .
 The library implements the algorithm described in the paper "Seam
 Carving for Content-Aware Image Resizing" by Shai Avidan and Ariel
 Shamir, which can be found at
 http://www.faculty.idc.ac.il/arik/imret.pdf

Description: HTTPS driver for LWP::UserAgent
 The LWP::Protocol::https module provides support for using HTTPS schemed URLs
 with LWP. LWP::Protocol::https is a plug-in to the LWP protocol handling, so
 you don't use it directly. Once the module is installed LWP is able to access
 sites using HTTP over SSL/TLS.
 .
 If hostname verification is requested by LWP::UserAgent's ssl_opts, and
 neither SSL_ca_file nor SSL_ca_path is set, then SSL_ca_file is implied to be
 the one provided by ca-certificates.
 .
 This module used to be bundled with libwww-perl, but it was unbundled in
 v6.02 in order to be able to declare its dependencies properly for the CPAN
 tool-chain. Applications that need HTTPS support can just declare their
 dependency on LWP::Protocol::https and will no longer need to know what
 underlying modules to install.

Description: Perl interface to the ISAAC PRNG Algorithm
 Math::Random::ISAAC implements the ISAAC (Indirection, Shift, Accumulate, Add
 and Count) pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) algorithm described on the
 project page at: <URL:http://burtleburtle.net/bob/rand/isaac.html>
 .
 As with other algorithms like the Mersenne Twister (see Math::Random::MT),
 this algorithm is designed to take some seed information and produce seemingly
 random results as output.
 .
 The results are uniformly distributed, unbiased, and unpredictable unless you
 know the seed. The algorithm was published by Bob Jenkins in the late 1990s
 and despite the best efforts of many security researchers, no feasible attacks
 have been found to date.
 .
 For comparison with other algorithms intended to generate random data, the
 Mersenne Twister has a period of 2^19937-1, the related TT800 has a period
 of 2^800-1 values. ISAAC has a period of 2^8295 values on average.

Description: Perl implementation of the ISAAC PRNG (C/XS Accelerated)
 Math::Random::ISAAC::XS implements the same interface as Math::Random::ISAAC
 and can be used as a drop-in replacement. This is the recommended version of
 the module, based on Bob Jenkins' reference implementation in C as described
 in his paper at: <URL:http://burtleburtle.net/bob/rand/isaac.html>
 .
 If you install this package, then any code that uses Math::Random::ISAAC will
 automagically benefit from this faster implementation. Performance increases
 are somewhere on the order of 400-500%.

Description: minimalistic Netlink communication library
 libmnl is a minimalistic user-space library oriented to Netlink developers.
 There are a lot of common tasks in parsing, validating, constructing of
 both the Netlink header and TLVs that are repetitive and easy to get wrong.
 This library aims to provide simple helpers that allows you to re-use code
 and to avoid re-inventing the wheel.
 .
 The main features of this library are:
 .
 Small: the shared library requires around 30KB for an x86-based computer.
 .
 Simple: this library avoids complexity and elaborated abstractions that
 tend to hide Netlink details.
 .
 Easy to use: the library simplifies the work for Netlink-wise developers.
 It provides functions to make socket handling, message building,
 validating, parsing and sequence tracking, easier.
 .
 Easy to re-use: you can use the library to build your own abstraction
 layer on top of this library.
 .
 Decoupling: the interdependency of the main bricks that compose the
 library is reduced, i.e. the library provides many helpers, but the
 programmer is not forced to use them.
 .
 This package contains the shared libraries needed to run programs that use
 the minimalistic Netlink communication library.

Description: modern Perl object system framework
 Moose is an extension of the Perl 5 object system. The main goal of Moose is to
 make Perl 5 Object Oriented programming easier, more consistent, and less
 tedious. With Moose you can think more about what you want to do and less about
 the mechanics of OOP.
 .
 Additionally, Moose is built on top of Class::MOP, which is a metaclass system
 for Perl 5. This means that Moose not only makes building normal Perl 5 objects
 better, but it provides the power of metaclass programming as well.
 .
 Moose also conveniently manages all attributes (including inherited ones) that
 are defined, but also provides facilities for properly initializing instance
 slots, setting defaults where appropriate and performing any necessary type
 constraint checking or coercion.
 .
 More details about the structure of Moose as well as its features can be found
 in the ever-expanding Moose::Cookbook document.

Description: MPEG1 and MPEG2 video decoder library
 libmpeg2 is a library which can decode MPEG1 and MPEG2 video streams.
 .
 The main features in libmpeg2 are:
 .
  * Conformance - libmpeg2 is able to decode all mpeg streams that conform to
    certain restrictions. For streams that follow these restrictions, libmpeg2
    is probably 100% conformant to the mpeg standards - and there's a pretty
    extensive test suite to check this.
 .
  * Speed - there has been huge efforts there, and libmpeg2 is probably the
    fastest library around for what it does.
 .
  * Portability - most of the code is written in C, and when platform-specific
    optimizations are used, there always is a generic C routine to fall back
    on.  This should be portable to all architectures - at least it is known
    people run this code on x86, ppc, sparc, arm and sh4.
 .
  * Reuseability - libmpeg2 is not intended to include any project-specific
    code, but it should still include enough features to be used by very
    diverse projects.
 .
 This package contains the libmpeg2 shared libraries.

Description: module providing low-level HTTP connection client
 The Net::HTTP class is a low-level HTTP client.  An instance of the
 Net::HTTP class represents a connection to an HTTP server.  The
 HTTP protocol is described in RFC 2616.  The Net::HTTP class
 supports HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1. Net::HTTP is a sub-class of IO::Socket::INET.
 You can mix its methods with reading and writing from the socket directly.
 This is not necessarily a good idea, unless you know what you are doing.

 Net::IP provides functions to deal with IPv4/IPv6 addresses.
 The module can be used as a class, allowing the user to instantiate IP
 objects, which can be single IP addresses, prefixes, or ranges of addresses.
 There is also a procedural way of accessing most of the functions. Most
 subroutines can take either IPv4 or IPv6 addresses transparently.

Description: module to parse, manipulate and lookup IP network blocks
 Net::Netmask parses and understands IPv4 and IPv6 CIDR blocks. It's built
 with an object-oriented interface, with functions being methods that operate
 on a Net::Netmask object.
 .
 These methods provide nearly all types of information about a network block
 that you might want.
 .
 There are also functions to insert a network block into a table and then
 later lookup network blocks by IP address using that table. There are
 functions to turn a IP address range into a list of CIDR blocks. There are
 functions to turn a list of CIDR blocks into a list of IP addresses.
 .
 There is a function for sorting by text IP address.
 .
 All functions understand both IPv4 and IPv6. Matches, finds, etc, will always
 return false when an IPv4 address is matched against an IPv6 address.

Description: Bring echo and more shell style goodies to Nginx
 Echo module wraps lots of Nginx internal APIs for streaming input and output,
 parallel/sequential subrequests, timers and sleeping, as well as various meta
 data accessing.
 .
 Basically it provides various utilities that help testing and debugging of
 other modules by trivially emulating different kinds of faked subrequest
 locations.
 .
 People will also find it useful in real-world applications that need to:
 .
 1. Serve static contents directly from memory.
 2. Wrap the upstream response with custom header and footer (kinda like the
    addition module but with contents read directly from the config file and
    Nginx variables).
 3. Merge contents of various "Nginx locations" (i.e., subrequests) together in
    a single main request (using echo_location and its friends).

Description: runtime files for the OpenEXR image library
 OpenEXR is a high dynamic-range (HDR) image file format developed by
 Industrial Light & Magic for use in computer imaging applications.
 .
 OpenEXR's features include:
    * Higher dynamic range and colour precision than existing 8- and
      10-bit image file formats.
    * Support for the "half" 16-bit floating-point pixel format.
    * Multiple lossless image compression algorithms. Some of the
      included codecs can achieve 2:1 lossless compression ratios on
      images with film grain.
    * Extensibility. New compression codecs and image types can easily
      be added by extending the C++ classes included in the OpenEXR
      software distribution. New image attributes (strings, vectors,
      integers, etc.) can be added to OpenEXR image headers without
      affecting backward compatibility with existing OpenEXR
      applications.
 .
 This package contains the following shared library:

Description: module to inspect and manipulate lexical variables
 PadWalker is a module that allows you to inspect and even modify lexical
 variables in the current "lexical pad stack." Perl tracks which variables
 are accessible and visible in each lexical scope by keeping a separate
 set of variables for each scope. This module looks for a given variable
 by traversing that stack, which allows it to alter anything in the stack,
 even variables not normally accessible in the current scope.
 .
 In practise, this module is useful for checking anything defined in the full
 stack of subroutines that called your function, making it extremely useful
 for debugging. It is, however, not recommended for use in production code.

Description: Perl module for argument type classification
 Params::Classify provides various type-testing functions. These are intended
 for functions that, unlike most Perl code, care what type of data they
 are operating on. For example, some functions wish to behave
 differently depending on the type of their arguments (like overloaded
 functions in C++).
 .
 These functions only provide type classification; they do not enforce
 type restrictions. Type enforcement may, of course, be built using
 these classification functions, but the reader's attention is drawn to
 libparams-validate-perl.

Description: OpenPGM shared library
 OpenPGM is an open source implementation of the Pragmatic General Multicast
 (PGM) specification in RFC 3208 available at www.ietf.org. PGM is a reliable
 and scalable multicast protocol that enables receivers to detect loss,
 request retransmission of lost data, or notify an application of
 unrecoverable loss. PGM is a receiver-reliable protocol, which means the
 receiver is responsible for ensuring all data is received, absolving the
 sender of reception responsibility. PGM runs over a best effort datagram
 service, currently OpenPGM uses IP multicast but could be implemented above
 switched fabrics such as InfiniBand.
 .
 This is the runtime package for programs that use the OpenPGM library.

 use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured
 data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages.
 You can even update your data structure without breaking deployed programs
 that are compiled against the "old" format.

 This library provides weak aliases for pthread functions not provided

 on pthread stubs to use pthreads optionally, becoming thread-safe when
 linked to libpthread, while avoiding any performance hit when running
 single-threaded. libpthread-stubs supports this behavior even on
 platforms which do not supply all the necessary pthread stubs.

 On platforms which already supply all the necessary pthread stubs, this
 package ships only the pkg-config file pthread-stubs.pc, to allow
 libraries to unconditionally express a dependency on pthread-stubs and
 still obtain correct behavior.

 librdmacm is a library that allows applications to set up reliable

 It provides a transport-neutral interface in the sense that the same
 code can be used for both InfiniBand and iWARP adapters.  The
 interface is based on sockets, but adapted for queue pair (QP) based
 semantics: communication must use a specific RDMA device, and data
 transfers are message-based.
 .
 librdmacm only provides communication management (connection setup
 and tear-down) and works in conjunction with the verbs interface
 provided by libibverbs, which provides the interface used to actually
 transfer data.

Description: efficient, principled regular expression library
 RE2 is a fast, safe, thread-friendly alternative to backtracking regular
 expression engines like those used in PCRE, Perl, and Python. It is a C++
 library.
 .
 RE2 uses automata theory to guarantee that regular expression searches run in
 time linear in the size of the input. RE2 implements memory limits, so that
 searches can be constrained to a fixed amount of memory. RE2 is engineered to
 use a small fixed C++ stack footprint no matter what inputs or regular
 expressions it must process; thus RE2 is useful in multithreaded environments
 where thread stacks cannot grow arbitrarily large.
 .
 On large inputs, RE2 is often much faster than backtracking engines; its use
 of automata theory lets it apply optimizations that the others cannot.

Description: utility to analysis for Windows NT-based registry (shared library)
 RegLookup is a system to direct analysis of Windows NT-based registry
 files providing command line tools, a C API, and a Python module for
 accessing registry data structures. The project has a focus on providing
 tools for digital forensics investigations (though is useful for many
 purposes), and includes algorithms for retrieving deleted data structures
 from registry hives.
 .
 Currently the program allows one to read an entire registry and output it
 in a (mostly) standardized, quoted format. It also provides features for
 filtering of results based on registry path and data type.
 .
 This package provides the runtime library.

Description: Perl module for minimalist role composition
 Role::Tiny is a Perl module to do minimalist role composition. Role composition
 can be thought of as much more clever and meaningful multiple inheritance.
 .
 The basics of this implementation of roles is:
  * If a method is already defined on a class, that method will not be composed
    in from the role.
  * If a method that the role "requires" to be implemented is not implemented,
    role application will fail loudly.
 .
 Unlike Class::C3, where the last class inherited from "wins," role composition
 is the other way around, where first wins. In a more complete system (see
 Moose) roles are checked to see if they clash. The goal of this is to be much
 simpler, hence disallowing composition of multiple roles at once.

 libsamplerate (aka Secret Rabbit Code) is a library for audio rate conversion.
 .
 libsamplerate currently provides three different sample rate conversion
 algorithms; zero order hold, linear interpolation and FIR filter interpolation
 (using filters derived from the mathematical SINC function). The first two
 algorithms (zero order hold and linear) are included for completeness and are
 not recommended for any application where high quality sample rate conversion
 is required. For the FIR/Sinc algorithm, three converters are provided;
 SRC_SINC_FASTEST, SRC_SINC_MEDIUM_QUALITY and SRC_SINC_BEST_QUALITY to allow a
 trade off between conversion speed and conversion quality.
 .
 libsamplerate is capable of downsampling to 1/256 of the original sample rate
 and upsampling to 256 times the original sample rate. It is also capable of
 time varying conversions for vary speed effects and synchronising of two
 unlocked sample rates.

Description: API library for scanners -- documentation and support files
 SANE stands for "Scanner Access Now Easy" and is an application
 programming interface (API) that provides standardized access to any
 raster image scanner hardware (flatbed scanner, hand-held scanner,
 video- and still-cameras, frame-grabbers, etc.). The SANE standard is
 free and its discussion and development are open to everybody. The
 current source code is written to support several operating systems,
 including GNU/Linux, OS/2, Win32 and various Unices and is available
 under the GNU General Public License (commercial applications and
 backends are welcome, too, however).
 .
 This package includes documentation for libsane, such as the man pages
 and list of supported scanners, and support files (i18n data).

 SASL is the Simple Authentication and Security Layer, a method for
 adding authentication support to connection-based protocols. To use
 SASL, a protocol includes a command for identifying and
 authenticating a user to a server and for optionally negotiating
 protection of subsequent protocol interactions. If its use is
 negotiated, a security layer is inserted between the protocol and the
 connection. See RFC 2222 for more information.
 .
 Any of: ANONYMOUS, CRAM-MD5, DIGEST-MD5, GSSAPI (MIT or Heimdal

 works with most newer systems.
 .
 This library is only functional with a Linux kernel, it is provided on
 non-Linux systems for portability reasons only.
 .
 This package contains a shared library for querying lm-sensors.

Description: SELinux library for manipulating binary security policies
 Security-enhanced Linux is a patch of the Linux kernel and a number
 of utilities with enhanced security functionality designed to add
 mandatory access controls to Linux.  The Security-enhanced Linux
 kernel contains new architectural components originally developed to
 improve the security of the Flask operating system. These
 architectural components provide general support for the enforcement
 of many kinds of mandatory access control policies, including those
 based on the concepts of Type Enforcement®, Role-based Access
 Control, and Multi-level Security.
 .
 libsepol provides an API for the manipulation of SELinux binary policies.
 It is used by checkpolicy (the policy compiler) and similar tools, as well
 as by programs like load_policy that need to perform specific transformations
 on binary policies such as customizing policy boolean settings.

Suggests: serdi
Description: lightweight RDF syntax library
 Serd is a lightweight C library for RDF syntax which supports reading
 and writing Turtle and NTriples.
 .
 Serd is not intended to be a swiss-army knife of RDF syntax, but rather
 is suited to resource limited applications, or situations where a simple
 reader/writer with minimal dependencies is ideal (e.g. in LV2 hosts or
 plugins).
 .
 Serd is:
  * small: Serd is implemented in under 2500 lines1 of standard C code.
  * portable and dependency-free: Serd uses only the C standard library,
    and has no external dependencies, making it a lightweight dependency
    in every sense.
  * fast and lightweight: Serd (and the included serdi tool) can be used
    to stream abbreviated Turtle (unlike many other tools which can not
    stream since they must first build an internal model to abbreviate).
    In other words, Serd can re-serialise an unbounded amount of Turtle
    using a fixed amount of memory, preserving the abbreviations in the
    input.
  * conformant and well-tested: Serd is written to the Turtle, NTriples
    and URI specifications, and includes a comprehensive test suite which
    includes all the normative examples from the Turtle specification, all
    the "normal" examples from the URI specification, and additional tests
    added specifically for Serd. The test suite has over 96% code coverage
    (by line), and runs with zero memory errors or leaks.

 .
 It incorporates extensible access to SMBIOS information capabilities and
 ability to perform unit tests across multiple systems without using physical
 hardware. Moreover, centralized, data-driven exception handling for broken
 BIOS tables is provided. Currently, full access to the SMBIOS table and its
 items is implemented. Additionally, access and manipulation of Dell Indexed
 IO Token (type 0xD4) is implemented. This token is a vendor-extention
 SMBIOS structure which allows uniform access to manipulate the system CMOS
 to enable, disable, or otherwise manipulate normal BIOS functions or features.

Description: HTTP library implementation in C -- GNOME support library
 It was originally part of a SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
 implementation called Soup, but the SOAP and non-SOAP parts have now been

 .
 libsoup uses the Glib main loop and is designed to work well with GTK+
 applications.  This enables GNOME applications to access HTTP servers
 on the network in a completely asynchronous fashion, very similar to
 the GTK+ programming model (a synchronous operation mode is also
 supported for those who want it).
 .
 The GNOME support library is used for features which are important to
 GNOME apps, but which require GNOME-specific libraries that non-GNOME
 apps may not want to add dependencies on.
 .
 Features:
  * Both asynchronous (GMainLoop and callback-based) and synchronous APIs
  * Automatically caches connections
  * SSL Support using GnuTLS
  * Proxy support, including authentication and SSL tunneling
  * Client support for Digest, NTLM, and Basic authentication
  * Server support for Digest and Basic authentication
  * Basic client-side SOAP and XML-RPC support

Description: Spiffy Perl Interface Framework For You
 "Spiffy" is a framework and methodology for doing object oriented (OO)
 programming in Perl. Spiffy combines the best parts of Exporter.pm,
 base.pm, mixin.pm and SUPER.pm into one magic foundation class. It
 attempts to fix all the nits and warts of traditional Perl OO, in a
 clean, straightforward and (perhaps someday) standard way.
 .
 Spiffy borrows ideas from other OO languages like Python, Ruby,
 Java and Perl 6. It also adds a few tricks of its own.
 .
 If you take a look on CPAN, there are a ton of OO related modules. When
 starting a new project, you need to pick the set of modules that makes
 most sense, and then you need to use those modules in each of your
 classes. Spiffy, on the other hand, has everything you'll probably need
 in one module, and you only need to use it once in one of your classes.
 If you make Spiffy.pm the base class of the basest class in your
 project, Spiffy will automatically pass all of its magic to all of your
 subclasses. You may eventually forget that you're even using it!

Description: Snowball stemming algorithms for use in Information Retrieval
 Snowball provides access to efficient algorithms for calculating a
 "stemmed" form of a word.  This is a form with most of the common
 morphological endings removed; hopefully representing a common
 linguistic base form.  This is most useful in building search engines
 and information retrieval software; for example, a search with stemming
 enabled should be able to find a document containing "cycling" given the
 query "cycles".
 .
 Snowball provides algorithms for several (mainly European) languages.
 It also provides access to the classic Porter stemming algorithm for
 English: although this has been superseded by an improved algorithm, the
 original algorithm may be of interest to information retrieval
 researchers wishing to reproduce results of earlier experiments.

Description: Software Token for cryptographic authentication - shared library
 stoken is a software token which generates one-time passwords compatible
 with RSA SecurID 128-bit (AES) tokens.  SecurID tokens are commonly
 used to authenticate end users to protected network resources and VPNs,
 as OTPs provide greater resistance to many attacks associated with static
 passwords.
 .
 stoken aims to provide a Linux-friendly, free software alternative to the
 proprietary RSA SecurID Software Authenticators.
 .
 This package provides a shared library allowing other applications, such
 as VPN clients and web browsers, to generate tokencodes.  This can improve
 both ease of use and security, as the user does not need to copy and paste
 tokencodes between applications.

Description: module for using Sub::Exporter only if needed
 Sub::Exporter is an incredibly powerful module, but with that power comes
 great responsibility, as well as some runtime penalties.
 Sub::Exporter::Progressive is a Sub::Exporter wrapper that will let your
 users just use Exporter if all they are doing is picking exports, but use
 Sub::Exporter if your users try to use Sub::Exporter's more advanced
 features, like renaming exports.
 .
 Note that this module will export @EXPORT and @EXPORT_OK package variables
 for Exporter to work. Additionally, if your package uses advanced
 Sub::Exporter features like currying, this module will only use
 Sub::Exporter, so you might as well use it directly.

Description: module to retrieve names of code references
 Sub::Identify allows you to retrieve the real name of code references. For
 this, it uses perl's introspection mechanism, provided by the B module.
 .
 It provides four functions : sub_name returns the name of the
 subroutine (or __ANON__ if it's an anonymous code reference),
 stash_name returns its package, and sub_fullname returns the
 concatenation of the two.
 .
 The fourth function, get_code_info, returns a list of two elements,
 the package and the subroutine name (in case of you want both and are worried
 by the speed.)
 .
 In case of subroutine aliasing, those functions always return the
 original name.

Description: FFmpeg library for audio resampling, rematrixing etc. - runtime files
 FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode,
 mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and
 machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the
 cutting edge.
 .
 This library provides performs highly optimized audio resampling, rematrixing
 and sample format conversion operations.
 Specifically, this library performs the following conversions:
  * Resampling is the process of changing the audio rate, for example from a
    high sample rate of 44100Hz to 8000Hz. Audio conversion from high to low
    sample rate is a lossy process. Several resampling options and algorithms
    are available.
  * Rematrixing is the process of changing the channel layout, for example from
    stereo to mono. When the input channels cannot be mapped to the output
    streams, the process is lossy, since it involves different gain factors
    and mixing. Various other audio conversions (e.g. stretching and padding)
    are enabled through dedicated options.
  * Format conversion is the process of converting the type of samples, for
    example from 16-bit signed samples to unsigned 8-bit or float samples.
    It also handles packing conversion, when passing from packed layout (all
    samples belonging to distinct channels interleaved in the same buffer), to
    planar layout (all samples belonging to the same channel stored in a
    dedicated buffer or "plane").

Description: comma-separated values manipulator (using XS or PurePerl)
 Text::CSV provides facilities for the composition and decomposition of files
 containing comma-separated value records. An instance of the Text::CSV class
 can combine fields into a CSV string and parse a CSV string into fields.
 .
 The module accepts either strings or files as input and can utilize any
 user-specified characters as delimiters, separators, and escapes so it is
 perhaps better called ASV (anything separated values) rather than just CSV.
 .
 This module will automatically select the best available implementation of
 the algorithm, whether the Pure Perl version present in this package, or the
 C/XS implementation, available in libtext-csv-xs-perl.

Description: library for forensics analysis on volume and filesystem data
 The Sleuth Kit, also known as TSK, is a collection of UNIX-based command
 line file and volume system forensic analysis tools. The filesystem tools
 allow you to examine filesystems of a suspect computer in a non-intrusive
 fashion. Because the tools do not rely on the operating system to process the
 filesystems, deleted and hidden content is shown.
 .
 The volume system (media management) tools allow you to examine the layout of
 disks and other media. You can also recover deleted files, get information
 stored in slack spaces, examine filesystems journal, see partitions layout on
 disks or images etc. But is very important clarify that the TSK acts over the
 current filesystem only.
 .
 The Sleuth Kit supports DOS partitions, BSD partitions (disk labels), Mac
 partitions, Sun slices (Volume Table of Contents), and GPT disks. With these
 tools, you can identify where partitions are located and extract them so that
 they can be analyzed with filesystem analysis tools.
 .
 Currently, TSK supports several filesystems, as NTFS, FAT, exFAT, HFS+, Ext3,
 Ext4, UFS and YAFFS2.
 .
 This package contains the library which can be used to implement all of the
 functionality of the command line tools into an application that needs to
 analyze data from a disk image.

 are correlated in some way to the audio currently being played by a media
 player. Most audio visualization is tied to a specific application or media
 player, making it difficult to share code. Libvisual allows applications
 to use existing visualization plugins written for the libvisual framework.
 .
 This package provides the runtime libraries for libvisual. Libvisual is not
 very useful without visualization plugins, so it is highly recommended to
 install the libvisual-0.4-plugins package.

 The main goal of the software is to allow restoring access to an encrypted
 hard drive if the primary user forgets the passphrase.  The encryption key
 back up can also be useful for extracting data after a hardware or software
 failure that corrupts the header of the encrypted volume, or to access the
 company data after an employee leaves abruptly.

Description: Web content engine library for GTK
 WebKit is a web content engine, derived from KHTML and KJS from KDE, and
 used primarily in Apple's Safari browser.  It is made to be embedded in
 other applications, such as mail readers, or web browsers.
 .
 It is able to display content such as HTML, SVG, XML, and others. It also
 supports DOM, XMLHttpRequest, XSLT, CSS, JavaScript/ECMAScript and more.
 .
 WebKit2 is an API layer for WebKit designed from the ground up to
 support a split process model, where the web content lives in a
 separate process from the application UI.
 .
 This build comes from the GTK port of WebKit (API version 4.0).
 .
 This is the library for embedding in GTK applications.

 implementation of important portions of the Windows API. Just like FreeRDP,
 WinPR is released under the Apache license. Unlike Wine, WinPR does not provide
 binary compatibility, and does not require applications to be built for
 Windows. Instead, WinPR provides API compatibility for applications targeting
 non-Windows environments. When on Windows, the original native API is being
 used instead of the equivalent WinPR implementation, without having to modify
 the code using it.
 .
 This package contains the WinPR shared library.

 Xlib:
 .
  * Size: small library and lower memory footprint
  * Latency hiding: batch several requests and wait for the replies later
  * Direct protocol access: one-to-one mapping between interface and protocol
  * Thread support: access XCB from multiple threads, with no explicit locking
  * Easy creation of new extensions: automatically generates interface from

 The XCB library provides an interface to the X Window System protocol,
 designed to replace the Xlib interface.  XCB provides several advantages over
 Xlib:
 .
  * Size: small library and lower memory footprint
  * Latency hiding: batch several requests and wait for the replies later
  * Direct protocol access: one-to-one mapping between interface and protocol
  * Thread support: access XCB from multiple threads, with no explicit locking
  * Easy creation of new extensions: automatically generates interface from

 CreateCursor request for rendering cursors.  Where the Render extension is
 not supported, Xcursor maps the cursor image to a standard X cursor and uses
 the core X protocol CreateCursor request.
 .
 Preferred themes for cursors can be installed if desired, via

 the X protocol.
 .
 The supported protocol extensions are:
  - DOUBLE-BUFFER (DBE), the Double Buffer extension;
  - DPMS, the VESA Display Power Management System extension;
  - Extended-Visual-Information (EVI), an extension for gathering extra
    information about the X server's visuals;
  - LBX, the Low Bandwidth X extension;
  - MIT-SHM, the MIT X client/server shared memory extension;
  - MIT-SUNDRY-NONSTANDARD, a miscellaneous extension by MIT;
  - Multi-Buffering, the multi-buffering and stereo display extension;
  - SECURITY, the X security extension;
  - SHAPE, the non-rectangular shaped window extension;
  - SYNC, the X synchronization extension;
  - TOG-CUP, the Open Group's Colormap Utilization extension;
  - XC-APPGROUP, the X Consortium's Application Group extension;
  - XC-MISC, the X Consortium's resource ID querying extension;
  - XTEST, the X test extension (this is one of two client-side
    implementations; the other is in the libXtst library, provided by the
    libxtst6 package);
 .
 libXext also provides a small set of utility functions to aid authors of
 client APIs for X protocol extensions.
 .
 This package contains the development headers for the library found in

Description: Perl module for parsing XML files
 The XML::Parser module provides ways to parse XML documents.  It is built on
 top of XML::Parser::Expat, which is a lower level interface to James Clark's
 expat library. Each call to one of the parsing methods creates a new instance
 of XML::Parser::Expat which is then used to parse the document. Expat options
 may be provided when the XML::Parser object is created. These options are
 then passed on to the Expat object on each parse call. They can also be given
 as extra arguments to the parse methods, in which case they override options
 given at XML::Parser creation time.
 .
 The behavior of the parser is controlled either by Style and/or Handlers
 options, or by setHandlers method. These all provide mechanisms for
 XML::Parser to set the handlers needed by XML::Parser::Expat. If neither
 Style nor Handlers are specified, then parsing just checks the document for
 being well-formed.
 .
 When underlying handlers get called, they receive as their first parameter
 the Expat object, not the Parser object.

Description: Perl module for using and building Perl SAX2 XML processors
 XML::SAX consists of several framework classes for using and
 building Perl SAX2 XML parsers, filters, and drivers.  It is designed
 around the need to be able to "plug in" different SAX parsers to an
 application without requiring programmer intervention.  Those of you
 familiar with the DBI will be right at home.  Some of the designs
 come from the Java JAXP specification (SAX part), only without the
 javaness.
 .
 The package also contains a SAX parser, XML::SAX::PurePerl, but it
 is considered too slow for serious use and is only provided as a
 fallback parser. It is recommend XML::SAX::Expat (provided in
 libxml-sax-expat-perl) instead.
 .
 The framework includes a Debian-specific script (called
 update-perl-sax-parsers) to manage the ParserDetails.ini file. This
 script is intended to be used in postinst and prerm package scripts to
 (de)register parsers.  See README.Debian for more info.

 This module provides a way to process XML documents.  It is built on

 .
 The module offers a tree interface to the document, while allowing to
 output the parts of it that have been completely processed.
 .
 It allows minimal resource (CPU and memory) usage by building the
 tree only for the parts of the documents that need actual processing,
 through the use of the twig_roots and twig_print_outside_roots
 options.  The finish and finish_print methods also help to increase
 performance.

Description: Perl module for writing XML documents
 XML::Writer is a helper module for Perl programs that write an XML
 document.  The module handles all escaping for attribute values and
 character data and constructs different types of markup, such as
 tags, comments, and processing instructions.
 .
 By default, the module performs several well-formedness checks to
 catch errors during output.  This behaviour can be extremely useful
 during development and debugging, but it can be turned off for
 production-grade code.
 .
 The module can operate either in regular mode in or Namespace
 processing mode.  In Namespace mode, the module will generate
 Namespace Declarations itself, and will perform additional checks on
 the output.
 .
 Additional support is available for a simplified data mode with no
 mixed content: newlines are automatically inserted around elements
 and elements can optionally be indented based as their nesting
 level.

Description: re-usable XPath engine for DOM-like trees
 XML::XPathEngine provides an XPath engine, that can be re-used by other
 module/classes that implement trees.
 .
 In order to use the XPath engine, nodes in the user module need to mimic
 DOM nodes. The degree of similarity between the user tree and a DOM dictates
 how much of the XPath features can be used. A module implementing all of the
 DOM should be able to use this module very easily (you might need to add
 the cmp method on nodes in order to get ordered result sets).
 .
 This module is derived from Matt Sergeant's XML::XPath.

Description: Vertical Blanking Interval decoder (VBI) - common files
 The vertical blanking interval (VBI) is an interval in a television signal
 that temporarily suspends transmission of the signal for the electron gun
 to move back up to the first line of the television screen to trace the
 next screen field.
 .
 The vertical blanking interval can be used to carry data, since anything
 sent during the VBI would naturally not be displayed; various test signals,
 closed captioning, and other digital data can be sent during this time
 period. These include information like closed-caption data, Teletext
 (primarily in Europe), and now Intercast and the ATVEC Internet television
 encodings.
 .
 The Zapping VBI library, in short ZVBI, provides functions to capture and
 decode VBI data. It is written in plain ANSI C with few dependencies on
 other tools and libraries, licensed under GPL. Some features:
   * Captures raw VBI samples from V4L, V4L2 and FreeBSD BKTR devices, sliced
     VBI data from Linux DVB devices;
   * Implements a VBI Proxy to share one VBI device between multiple
     applications;
   * Has a robust and versatile bit slicer which handles a wide range of data
     services;
   * Functions to capture multiple data services at once, such as Closed
     Caption (both NTSC and PAL), Teletext, VPS, WSS, XDS;
   * Level 3.5 Teletext decoder with support for all Teletext character sets,
     graphics, 4096 colors, with built-in page cache including search
     functions;
   * Closed Caption decoder which supports roll-up, pop-up and paint-on style
     caption, color, expanded character set, text attributes and free text
     placement;
   * Renders Teletext and Caption pages, can export to HTML, PNG and other
     formats.
   * Can determine network names;
   * Can find Teletext subtitle and program pages;
   * Functions to extract data transmissions in Teletext streams (currently
     Page Format Clear and Independent Data Line Format A);
   * Can multiplex and demultiplex DVB VBI PES and TS streams.

Description: Modular compiler and toolchain technologies
 LLVM is a collection of libraries and tools that make it easy to build
 compilers, optimizers, just-in-time code generators, and many other
 compiler-related programs.
 .
 LLVM uses a single, language-independent virtual instruction set both
 as an offline code representation (to communicate code between
 compiler phases and to run-time systems) and as the compiler internal
 representation (to analyze and transform programs). This persistent
 code representation allows a common set of sophisticated compiler
 techniques to be applied at compile-time, link-time, install-time,
 run-time, or "idle-time" (between program runs).
 .
 The strengths of the LLVM infrastructure are its extremely
 simple design (which makes it easy to understand and use),
 source-language independence, powerful mid-level optimizer, automated
 compiler debugging support, extensibility, and its stability and
 reliability. LLVM is currently being used to host a wide variety of
 academic research projects and commercial projects. LLVM includes C
 and C++ front-ends, a front-end for a Forth-like language (Stacker),
 a young scheme front-end, and Java support is in development. LLVM can
 generate code for X86, SparcV9, PowerPC or many other architectures.

Description: LPeg library for the Lua language
 LPeg is a new pattern-matching library for Lua, based on Parsing Expression
 Grammars (PEGs). PEGs look similar to regular expressions or context-free
 grammars in Backus-Naur form (BNF) notation. PEGs make a good replacement for
 regular expressions, because they are strictly more powerful. For example, a
 regular expression inherently cannot find matched pairs of parentheses, because
 it is not recursive, but a PEG can.

Description: utility for manipulating the MAC address of network interfaces
 GNU MAC Changer is an utility that makes the maniputation of MAC addresses of
 network interfaces easier.  MAC addresses are unique identifiers on networks,
 they only need to be unique, they can be changed on most network hardware.
 MAC addresses have started to be abused by unscrupulous marketing firms,
 government agencies, and others to provide an easy way to track a computer
 across multiple networks.  By changing the MAC address regularly, this kind
 of tracking can be thwarted, or at least made a lot more difficult.
 .
 Features:
 .
   * set specific MAC address of a network interface
   * set the MAC randomly
   * set a MAC of another vendor
   * set another MAC of the same vendor
   * set a MAC of the same kind (eg: wireless card)
   * display a vendor MAC list (today, 6200 items) to choose from

Description: recover files by looking for magic bytes
 Magic Rescue scans a block device for file types it knows how to recover
 and calls an external program to extract them. It looks at "magic bytes"
 (file patterns) in file contents, so it can be used both as an undelete
 utility and for recovering a corrupted drive or partition. As long as
 the file data is there, it will find it.
 .
 Magic Rescue uses files called 'recipes'. These files have strings and
 commands to identify and extract data from devices or forensics images.
 So, you can write your own recipes. Currently, there are the following
 recipes: avi, canon-cr2, elf, flac, gpl, gzip, jpeg-exif, jpeg-jfif,
 mbox, mbox-mozilla-inbox, mbox-mozilla-sent, mp3-id3v1, mp3-id3v2,
 msoffice, nikon-raw, perl, png, ppm, sqlite and zip.
 .
 This package provides magicrescue, dupemap and magicsort commands.
 magicrescue is a carver and is useful in forensics investigations.

Depends: libc6 (>= 2.14)
Description: high-performance word generator with a per-position configurable charset
 Maskprocessor is a fast word list generator. It enumerates all combinations
 from a given user-defined keyspace and outputs the results. Since it supports
 different alphabets (which also can be combined) at different positions in the
 generation template ('mask'), this approach allows a more fine-tunable
 generation of candidates than using 'naive' brute force enumeration of words.
 Masks are defined using the description also used in the Hashcat password
 recovery utility.

Description: a pattern scanning and text processing language
 Mawk is an interpreter for the AWK Programming Language. The AWK
 language is useful for manipulation of data files, text retrieval and

 is a new awk meaning it implements the AWK language as defined in Aho,
 Kernighan and Weinberger, The AWK Programming Language, Addison-Wesley
 Publishing, 1988. (Hereafter referred to as the AWK book.) Mawk conforms
 to the POSIX 1003.2 (draft 11.3) definition of the AWK language
 which contains a few features not described in the AWK book, and mawk
 provides a small number of extensions.
 .
 Mawk is smaller and much faster than gawk. It has some compile-time
 limits such as NF = 32767 and sprintf buffer = 1020.

Description: fast, parallel, modular, login brute-forcer for network services
 Medusa is intended to be a speedy, massively parallel, modular, login
 brute-forcer. The goal is to support as many services which allow remote
 authentication as possible. The author considers following items as some of
 the key features of this application:
      * Thread-based parallel testing. Brute-force testing can be
        performed against multiple hosts, users or passwords
        concurrently.
      * Flexible user input. Target information (host/user/password) can
        be specified in a variety of ways. For example, each item can be
        either a single entry or a file containing multiple entries.
        Additionally, a combination file format allows the user to
        refine their target listing.
      * Modular design. Each service module exists as an
        independent .mod file. This means that no modifications are
        necessary to the core application in order to extend the
        supported list of services for brute-forcing.

Description: quickly find files on the filesystem based on their name
 mlocate is a new implementation of locate, a tool to find files
 anywhere in the filesystem based on their name, using a fixed pattern
 or a regular expression. Unlike other tools like find(1), locate uses
 a previously created database to perform the search, allowing queries
 to execute much faster. This database is updated periodically from
 cron.
 .
 Several implementations of locate exist: the original implementation
 from GNU's findutils, slocate, and mlocate. The advantages of mlocate
 are:
 .
  * it indexes all the filesystem, but results of a search will only
    include files that the user running locate has access to. It does
    this by updating the database as root, but making it unreadable for
    normal users, who can only access it via the locate binary. slocate
    does this as well, but not the original locate.
 .
  * instead of re-reading all the contents of all directories each time
    the database is updated, mlocate keeps timestamp information in its
    database and can know if the contents of a directory changed without
    reading them again. This makes updates much faster and less demanding
    on the hard drive. This feature is only found in mlocate.
 .
 Installing mlocate will change the /usr/bin/locate binary to point to
 mlocate via the alternatives mechanism. After installation, you may
 wish to run /etc/cron.daily/mlocate by hand to create the database,
 otherwise mlocate won't work until that script is run from cron itself
 (since mlocate does not use the same database file as standard locate).
 Also, you may wish to remove the "locate" package in order not to have
 two different database files updated regularly on your system.

Description: Mono runtime - common files
 Mono is a platform for running and developing applications based on the
 ECMA/ISO Standards. Mono is an open source effort led by Xamarin.
 Mono provides a complete CLR (Common Language Runtime) including compiler and
 runtime, which can produce and execute CIL (Common Intermediate Language)
 bytecode (aka assemblies), and a class library.
 .
 This package contains common files for the Virtual Machine, JIT (Just-in-Time) and
 AOT (Ahead-of-Time) code generator "mono".
 "mono" executes applications for the CLI (Common Language Infrastructure).
 Mono currently only supports the X86, PowerPC, ARM, S/390x, AMD64 and
 MIPS architectures. Optionally this package configures BINFMT support.

Description: Netcat for the 21st century
 Ncat is a feature-packed networking utility which reads and writes data across
 networks from the command line. Ncat was written for the Nmap Project as a
 much-improved reimplementation of the venerable Netcat. It uses both TCP and
 UDP for communication and is designed to be a reliable back-end tool to
 instantly provide network connectivity to other applications and users. Ncat
 will not only work with IPv4 and IPv6 but provides the user with a virtually
 limitless number of potential uses.
 .
 Among Ncat’s vast number of features there is the ability to chain Ncats
 together, redirect both TCP and UDP ports to other sites, SSL support, and
 proxy connections via SOCKS4 or HTTP (CONNECT method) proxies (with optional
 proxy authentication as well). Some general principles apply to most
 applications and thus give you the capability of instantly adding networking
 support to software that would normally never support it.

Description: High-speed network authentication cracking tool
 Ncrack is a high-speed network authentication cracking tool.
 It was built to help companies secure their networks by
 proactively testing all their hosts and networking devices
 for poor passwords. Security professionals also rely on
 Ncrack when auditing their clients. Ncrack was designed
 using a modular approach, a command-line syntax similar to
 Nmap and a dynamic engine that can adapt its behaviour
 based on network feedback. It allows for rapid, yet
 reliable large-scale auditing of multiple hosts.
 .
 Ncrack's features include a very flexible interface granting
 the user full control of network operations, allowing for
 very sophisticated bruteforcing attacks, timing templates
 for ease of use, runtime interaction similar to Nmap's and
 many more. Protocols supported include RDP, SSH, http(s),
 SMB, pop3(s), VNC, FTP, and telnet.
 .
 Be sure to read the Ncrack man page (https://nmap.org/ncrack/man.html)
 to fully understand Ncrack usage.

 Netdiscover can also be used to inspect your network ARP traffic,
 or find network addresses using auto scan mode, which will scan for
 common local networks.
 .
 Netdiscover uses the OUI table to show the vendor of the each MAC
 address discovered and is very useful for security checks or in
 pentests.

Description: network packet-altering stream editor
 NetSED is a small and handy utility designed to alter, in real time,
 the contents of packets forwarded through your network. It is really
 useful for network packet alteration, forging, or manipulation.
 NetSED supports:
 .
   * black-box protocol auditing - whenever there are two or more
     proprietary boxes communicating using some undocumented protocol.
     By enforcing changes in ongoing transmissions, you will be able
     to test if the examined application can be claimed secure;
   * fuzz generating experiments, integrity tests - whenever you do
     stability tests of an application to see how it cares for data
     integrity;
   * other common use-cases: deceptive transfers, content filtering,
     protocol conversion - whatever best fits your task at hand.
 .
 It ideally complements a tool suite based on ngrep, netcat, and tcpdump.

Description: ID-spoofing NFS client
 NfSpy is a Python library for automating the falsification of NFS credentials
 when mounting an NFS share. Included are two client programs:
 .
    nfspy uses the Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) library to mount an NFS share
    in Linux. This allows the use of any regular file-searching and
    manipulation programs like grep and find to explore the NFS export.
 .
    nfspysh is a ftp-like interactive shell for exploring NFS exports. It does
    not require the FUSE library, so it can run on non-Linux platforms.

Description: incremental implementation of MurmurHash3 hashing algorithm
 This module is an incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit)
 hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on Gary Court's implementation with
 kazuyukitanimura's modifications.
 .
 This version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if
 you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string
 concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version)
 is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about
 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.

 If you `move` across devices or on filesystems that don't support renaming
 large directories.  That is, situations that result in `rename` returning
 the `EXDEV` error, then `move` will fallback to copy + delete.

Description: shim for require.main.filename() that works in as many environments as possible
 require.main.filename is great for figuring out the entry point for the

 .
 Unfortunately, require.main.filename sometimes fails when an application
 is executed with an alternative process manager, e.g., iisnode.

 wcwidth.js is a simple javascript porting of wcwidth()
 implemented in C by Markus Kuhn.

 wcwidth() and its string version, wcswidth() are defined by
 IEEE Std 1002.1-2001, a.k.a. POSIX.1-2001, and return the
 number of columns used to represent a wide character and
 string on fixed-width output devices like terminals.
 Markus's implementation assumes wide characters to be
 encoded in ISO 10646, which is almost true for JavaScript;
 almost because JavaScript uses UCS-2 and has problems
 with surrogate pairs. wcwidth.js converts surrogate pairs
 to Unicode code points to handle them correctly.

Description: Network Time Protocol daemon and utility programs
 NTP, the Network Time Protocol, is used to keep computer clocks
 accurate by synchronizing them over the Internet or a local network,
 or by following an accurate hardware receiver that interprets GPS,
 DCF-77, NIST or similar time signals.
 .
 This package contains the NTP daemon and utility programs.  An NTP
 daemon needs to be running on each host that is to have its clock
 accuracy controlled by NTP.  The same NTP daemon is also used to
 provide NTP service to other hosts.
 .
 For more information about the NTP protocol and NTP server
 configuration and operation, install the package "ntp-doc".

Description: RTP fuzzer
 ohrwurm is a small and simple RTP fuzzer that has been
 successfully tested on a small number of SIP phones.
 Features:
 .
     - reads SIP messages to get information of the RTP port
     numbers
     - reading SIP can be omitted by providing the RTP port
     numbers, sothat any RTP traffic can be fuzzed
     - RTCP traffic can be suppressed to avoid that codecs
     - learn about the "noisy line"
     - special care is taken to break RTP handling itself
     - the RTP payload is fuzzed with a constant BER
     - the BER is configurable
     - requires arpspoof from dsniff to do the MITM attack
     - requires both phones to be in a switched LAN (GW
     operation only works partially)

Description: Smart card utilities with support for PKCS#15 compatible cards
 OpenSC provides a set of libraries and utilities to access smart
 cards.  It mainly focuses on cards that support cryptographic
 operations. It facilitates their use in security applications such as
 mail encryption, authentication, and digital signature. OpenSC
 implements the PKCS#11 API. Applications supporting this API, such as
 Iceweasel and Icedove, can use it. OpenSC implements the PKCS#15
 standard and aims to be compatible with all software that does so as
 well.
 .
 Before purchasing any cards, please read carefully documentation in
 /usr/share/doc/opensc/html/wiki/index.html - only some cards are
 supported. Not only does card type matters, but also card version,
 card OS version and preloaded applet. Only a subset of possible
 operations may be supported for your card. Card initialization may
 require third party proprietary software.
 .
 This package contains tools for interacting with smart cards.

Description: Smart card utilities with support for PKCS#15 compatible cards
 OpenSC provides a set of libraries and utilities to access smart
 cards.  It mainly focuses on cards that support cryptographic
 operations. It facilitates their use in security applications such as
 mail encryption, authentication, and digital signature. OpenSC
 implements the PKCS#11 API. Applications supporting this API, such as
 Iceweasel and Icedove, can use it. OpenSC implements the PKCS#15
 standard and aims to be compatible with all software that does so as
 well.
 .
 Before purchasing any cards, please read carefully documentation in
 /usr/share/doc/opensc/html/wiki/index.html - only some cards are
 supported. Not only does card type matters, but also card version,
 card OS version and preloaded applet. Only a subset of possible
 operations may be supported for your card. Card initialization may
 require third party proprietary software.
 .
 This package contains the pkcs11 module.

Description: secure shell (SSH) client, for secure access to remote machines
 This is the portable version of OpenSSH, a free implementation of
 the Secure Shell protocol as specified by the IETF secsh working
 group.
 .
 Ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote machine
 and for executing commands on a remote machine.
 It provides secure encrypted communications between two untrusted
 hosts over an insecure network. X11 connections and arbitrary TCP/IP
 ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
 It can be used to provide applications with a secure communication
 channel.
 .
 This package provides the ssh, scp and sftp clients, the ssh-agent
 and ssh-add programs to make public key authentication more convenient,
 and the ssh-keygen, ssh-keyscan, ssh-copy-id and ssh-argv0 utilities.
 .
 In some countries it may be illegal to use any encryption at all
 without a special permit.
 .
 ssh replaces the insecure rsh, rcp and rlogin programs, which are
 obsolete for most purposes.

Description: Provides a package management service
 PackageKit allows performing simple software management tasks over a DBus
 interface e.g. refreshing the cache, updating, installing and removing
 software packages or searching for multimedia codecs and file handlers.
 .
 The work is done by backends which make use of the package manager shipped by
 the corresponding distribution. PackageKit is not meant to replace
 advanced tools like Synaptic.
 .
 The main benefits are:
  - unified interface on several distributions
  - fine grained privileges by using PolicyKit
  - independency from a running desktop session during the processing

Description: disk partition manipulator
 GNU Parted is a program that allows you to create, destroy, resize,
 move, and copy disk partitions. This is useful for creating space
 for new operating systems, reorganizing disk usage, and copying data
 to new hard disks.
 .
 This package contains the binary and manual page. Further
 documentation is available in parted-doc.
 .
 Parted currently supports DOS, Mac, Sun, BSD, GPT, MIPS, and PC98
 partitioning formats, as well as a "loop" (raw disk) type which
 allows use on RAID/LVM. It can detect and remove ASFS/AFFS/APFS,
 Btrfs, ext2/3/4, FAT16/32, HFS, JFS, linux-swap, UFS, XFS, and ZFS
 file systems. Parted also has the ability to create and modify file
 systems of some of these types, but using it to perform file system
 operations is now deprecated.
 .
 The nature of this software means that any bugs could cause massive
 data loss. While there are no such bugs known at the moment, they
 could exist, so please back up all important files before running
 it, and do so at your own risk.

Description: Larry Wall's Practical Extraction and Report Language
 Perl is a highly capable, feature-rich programming language with over
 20 years of development. Perl 5 runs on over 100 platforms from
 portables to mainframes. Perl is suitable for both rapid prototyping
 and large scale development projects.
 .
 Perl 5 supports many programming styles, including procedural,
 functional, and object-oriented. In addition to this, it is supported
 by an ever-growing collection of reusable modules which accelerate
 development. Some of these modules include Web frameworks, database
 integration, networking protocols, and encryption. Perl provides
 interfaces to C and C++ for custom extension development.

 making changes or backups on many devices without having to log into each
 device or write messy expect type scripts that need constant tweaking.

Description: version compatibility baseline for Perl OpenSSL packages
 A subset of Perl XS module packages expose the OpenSSL binary interface
 to Perl code. This can lead to incompatibilities if these packages are
 linked against different versions of OpenSSL.
 .
 This package provides a virtual package "perl-openssl-abi-x" that
 corresponds to the libssl-dev package SONAME it was built against.
 The packages that need to stay compatible with each other can depend
 on this.
 .
 Tools are also provided for generating this dependency with minimum
 hassle. See the instructions in README.Debian.

Description: Perl module providing the Tk graphics library
 Perl/Tk (also known as pTk or ptk) is a collection of modules and
 code that attempts to wed the easily configured Tk widget toolkit
 to the powerful lexigraphic, dynamic memory, I/O, and object-oriented
 capabilities of Perl 5. In other words, it is an interpreted
 scripting language for making widgets and programs with Graphical
 User Interfaces (GUI).
 .
 A good place to get started is by running the "widget" demo that's
 installed with this package.

Description: GNOME 3 PIN or pass-phrase entry dialog for GnuPG
 This package contains a program that allows for secure entry of PINs or
 pass phrases.  That means it tries to take care that the entered
 information is not swapped to disk or temporarily stored anywhere.
 This functionality is particularly useful for entering pass phrases
 when using encryption software such as GnuPG or e-mail clients using
 the same.  It uses an open protocol and is therefore not tied to
 particular software.
 .
 The program contained in this package implements a PIN entry dialog
 designed for use with GNOME 3.  It tries to follow the GNOME Human
 Interface Guidelines as much as possible.  If the X Window System is
 not active then an alternative text-mode dialog will be used.  There
 are sibling packages that implement PIN entry dialogs using other
 tool kits.

 much better latency, mixing/re-sampling quality and overall architecture.
 .
 These are some of PulseAudio's features:
 .
   * High quality software mixing of multiple audio streams with support for
     more than one sink/source. May be used to combine multiple sound cards
     into one (with sample rate adjustment).
 .
   * Wide range of supported client libraries. ESD, ALSA, oss, libao and
     GStreamer client applications are supported as-is. Native PulseAudio
     plug-ins are also available for xmms and mplayer.
 .
   * Good low latency behaviour and very accurate latency measurement for
     playback and recording. Ability to fully synchronize multiple playback
     streams.
 .
   * Network transparency, allowing an application to play back or record
     audio on a different machine than the one it is running on.
 .
   * Extensible plug-in architecture with plug-ins for jackd, multicast-rtp
     lirc and avahi, just to name a few.

 Editor first looks for the  environment variable.  If set, it uses
 the value as-is, without fallbacks. If no $EDITOR is set, editor will search
 through a list of known editors, and use the first one that exists on the
 system. For example, on Linux, editor will look for the following editors in
 order:
  * vim
  * emacs
  * nano
 .
 When calling the edit() function, editor will open the editor in a
 subprocess, inheriting the parent process's stdin, stdout

Description: date and time handling routines for Python
 mxDateTime is a Python extension package that provides three new
 objects, DateTime, DateTimeDelta and RelativeDateTime, which let you
 store and handle date/time values in a much more natural way than by
 using ticks (seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC), the representation
 used by Python's time module).
 .
 You can add, subtract and even multiply instances, pickle and copy
 them and convert the results to strings, COM dates, ticks and some
 other more esoteric values. In addition, there are several convenient
 constructors and formatters at hand to greatly simplify dealing with
 dates and times in real-world applications.
 .
 In addition to providing an easy-to-use Python interface the package
 also exports a comfortable C API interface for other extensions to
 build upon. This is especially interesting for database applications
 which often have to deal with date/time values (the mxODBC package is
 one example of an extension using this interface).
 .
 mxDateTime can convert between various different date/time storage
 formats, including COM dates, TJD, MJD, JDN, tuples and, probably
 most important, strings.
 .
 The date/time parser included in mxDateTime is one of the most
 flexible such parser available for Python. It is constantly being
 improved to make parsing date/time strings as easy as possible. At
 the same time, it offers a fully customizable interface which allows
 selecting valid date/time formats from a range of predefined
 categories.
 .
 There are also special parser and formatter modules for ARPA and ISO
 date/time formats, which are handy if you work a lot with Internet
 standards.

 Elixir does not intend to replace SQLAlchemy's core features, but instead
 focuses on providing a simpler syntax for defining model objects when you do
 not need the full expressiveness of SQLAlchemy's manual mapper definitions.
 .
 Elixir is intended to replace the ActiveMapper SQLAlchemy extension, and the
 TurboEntity project.

Description: small but fast and easy to use stand-alone template engine
 Jinja2 is a template engine written in pure Python. It provides a Django
 inspired non-XML syntax but supports inline expressions and an optional
 sandboxed environment.
 .
 The key-features are:
  * Configurable syntax. If you are generating LaTeX or other formats with
    Jinja2 you can change the delimiters to something that integrates better
    into the LaTeX markup.
  * Fast. While performance is not the primarily target of Jinja2 it’s
    surprisingly fast. The overhead compared to regular Python code was reduced
    to the very minimum.
  * Easy to debug. Jinja2 integrates directly into the Python traceback system
    which allows you to debug Jinja2 templates with regular Python debugging
    helpers.
  * Secure. It’s possible to evaluate untrusted template code if the optional
    sandbox is enabled. This allows Jinja2 to be used as templating language
    for applications where users may modify the template design.

 jsonpickle is a Python library for serialization and deserialization of
 complex Python objects to and from JSON. The standard Python libraries for
 encoding Python into JSON, such as the stdlib’s json, simplejson, and
 demjson,  can only handle Python primitives that have a direct JSON
 equivalent (e.g. dicts, lists, strings, ints, etc.). jsonpickle builds on
 top of these libraries and allows more complex data structures to be
 serialized to JSON. jsonpickle is highly configurable and
 extendable–allowing the user to choose the JSON backend  and add additional
 backends.

 easily be modified to use JSON and experiment with the differences.
 .
 It is backwards-compatible with the 1.0 specification, and supports all of the
 new proposed features of 2.0, including:
  * Batch submission (via MultiCall)
  * Keyword arguments
  * Notifications (both in a batch and 'normal')
  * Class translation using the 'jsonclass' key.

Description: fast and lightweight templating for the Python platform
 Mako is a template library written in Python. It provides a familiar, non-XML
 syntax which compiles into Python modules for maximum performance. Mako's
 syntax and API borrows from the best ideas of many others, including Django
 templates, Cheetah, Myghty, and Genshi. Conceptually, Mako is an embedded
 Python (i.e. Python Server Page) language, which refines the familiar ideas of
 componentized layout and inheritance to produce one of the most
 straightforward and flexible models available, while also maintaining close
 ties to Python calling and scoping semantics.

Version: 1.2.1+dfsg-1
Description: matplotlib toolkit to plot on map projections (data package)
 The matplotlib basemap toolkit is a library for plotting 2D data on maps in
 Python. It is similar in functionality to the matlab mapping toolbox, the IDL
 mapping facilities, GrADS, or the Generic Mapping Tools. PyNGL and CDAT are
 other libraries that provide similar capabilities in Python.
 .
 Basemap does not do any plotting on its own, but provides the facilities to
 transform coordinates to one of 23 different map projections (using the PROJ.4
 C library). Matplotlib is then used to plot contours, images, vectors, lines or
 points in the transformed coordinates. Shoreline, river and political boundary
 datasets (from Generic Mapping Tools) are provided, along with methods for
 plotting them. The GEOS library is used internally to clip the coastline and
 political boundary features to the desired map projection region.
 .
 Basemap provides facilities for reading data in netCDF and Shapefile formats,
 as well as directly over http using OPeNDAP. This functionality is provided
 through the PyDAP client, and a Python interface to the Shapefile C library.
 .
 Basemap is geared toward the needs of earth scientists, particular
 oceanographers and meteorologists. The author originally wrote Basemap to help
 in his research (climate and weather forecasting), since at the time CDAT was
 the only other tool in Python for plotting data on map projections. Over the
 years, the capabilities of Basemap have evolved as scientists in other
 disciplines (such as biology, geology and geophysics) requested and contributed
 new features.

Description: PDF analysis tool (Python 2)
 peepdf is a Python tool to explore PDF files in order to
 find out if the file can be harmful or not. The aim of this
 tool is to provide all the necessary components that a
 security researcher could need in a PDF analysis without
 using 3 or 4 tools to make all the tasks. With peepdf it's
 possible to see all the objects in the document showing the
 suspicious elements, supports all the most used filters and
 encodings, it can parse different versions of a file,
 object streams and encrypted files. With the installation
 of Spidermonkey and Libemu it provides Javascript and
 shellcode analysis wrappers too. Apart of this it's able
 to create new PDF files and to modify existent ones.

Description: Portable Executable (PE) parsing module for Python
 pefile is a Python module to read and work with Portable Executable (PE)
 files. Most of the information in the PE header is accessible, as well as all
 the sections, section information and data.
 .
 All the basic PE file structures are available with their default names as
 attributes of the returned instance.
 .
 Processed elements such as the import table are made available with lowercase
 names, to differentiate them from the upper case basic structure names.
 .
 pefile has been tested against the limits of valid PE headers; that is,
 Windows malware. Lots of packed malware attempt to abuse the format beyond its
 standard use.
 .
 Some of the tasks that pefile makes possible are:
  * Modifying and writing back to the PE image
  * Header inspection
  * Section analysis
  * Retrieving data
  * Warnings for suspicious and malformed values
  * Packer detection with PEiD signatures
  * PEiD signature generation

Description: Python module for PostgreSQL
 psycopg is a PostgreSQL database adapter for the Python programming language
 (just like pygresql and popy.) This is version 2, a complete rewrite of the
 original code to provide new-style classes for connection and cursor objects
 and other sweet candies. Like the original, psycopg 2 was written with the
 aim of being very small and fast, and stable as a rock.
 .
 psycopg is different from the other database adapter because it was designed
 for heavily multi-threaded applications that create and destroy lots of
 cursors and make a conspicuous number of concurrent INSERTs or UPDATEs.
 psycopg 2 also provides full asynchronous operations for the really brave
 programmer.
 .
 The main advantages of psycopg2 are that it supports the full Python DBAPI-2.0
 and being thread safe at level 2. It also includes some extensions to the
 standard DBAPI-2.0 to allow for better thread performance.

Description: cryptographic Python library (Python 2)
 PyCryptodome is a self-contained Python package of low-level
 cryptographic primitives.
 .
 PyCryptodome is a fork of PyCrypto. It brings several enhancements
 with respect to the last official version of PyCrypto (2.6.1),
 for instance:
 .
   * Authenticated encryption modes (GCM, CCM, EAX, SIV, OCB)
   * Accelerated AES on Intel platforms via AES-NI
   * First class support for PyPy
   * Elliptic curves cryptography (NIST P-256 curve only)
   * Better and more compact API (`nonce` and `iv` attributes for ciphers,
     automatic generation of random nonces and IVs, simplified CTR cipher mode,
     and more)
   * SHA-3 (including SHAKE XOFs) and BLAKE2 hash algorithms
   * Salsa20 and ChaCha20 stream ciphers
   * scrypt and HKDF
   * Deterministic (EC)DSA
   * Password-protected PKCS#8 key containers
   * Shamir's Secret Sharing scheme
   * Random numbers get sourced directly from the OS (and not from a CSPRNG in
     userspace)
   * Simplified install process, including better support for Windows
   * Cleaner RSA and DSA key generation (largely based on FIPS 186-4)
   * Major clean ups and simplification of the code base
 .
 PyCryptodome is not a wrapper to a separate C library like *OpenSSL*.
 To the largest possible extent, algorithms are implemented in pure Python.
 Only the pieces that are extremely critical to performance (e.g. block ciphers)
 are implemented as C extensions.
 .
 This is the Python 2 version of the package.

Description: alternative to creating and executing simple grammars - Python 2.7
 The parsing module is an alternative approach to creating and
 executing simple grammars, vs. the traditional lex/yacc approach, or
 the use of regular expressions.  The parsing module provides a
 library of classes that client code uses to construct the grammar
 directly in Python code.
 .
 Here's an example:
 .
  from pyparsing import Word, alphas
  greet = Word(alphas) + "," + Word(alphas) + "!"
  hello = "Hello, World!"
  print hello, "->", greet.parseString(hello)
 .
 This package contains the Python 2.7 module.

Description: Pure-Python library built as a PDF toolkit (Python 2)
 A Pure-Python library built as a PDF toolkit.  It is capable of:
   - extracting document information (title, author, ...),
   - splitting documents page by page,
   - merging documents page by page,
   - cropping pages,
   - merging multiple pages into a single page,
   - encrypting and decrypting PDF files.
 .
 By being Pure-Python, it should run on any Python platform without any
 dependencies on external libraries.  It can also work entirely on StringIO
 objects rather than file streams, allowing for PDF manipulation in memory.
 It is therefore a useful tool for websites that manage or manipulate PDFs.
 .
 This is the Python 2 version of the package.

Description: Python interface to SQLite 3
 pysqlite is a DB-API 2.0-compliant database interface for SQLite.
 .
 This package is built against SQLite 3. For an interface to SQLite 2,
 see the package python-sqlite. An alternative Python SQLite 3 module
 is packaged as python-apsw.
 .
 SQLite is a relational database management system contained in a
 relatively small C library. It is a public domain project created
 by D. Richard Hipp. Unlike the usual client-server paradigm, the
 SQLite engine is not a standalone process with which the program
 communicates, but is linked in and thus becomes an integral part
 of the program. The library implements most of SQL-92 standard,
 including transactions, triggers and most of complex queries.
 .
 pysqlite makes this powerful embedded SQL engine available to
 Python programmers. It stays compatible with the Python database
 API specification 2.0 as much as possible, but also exposes most
 of SQLite's native API, so that it is for example possible to
 create user-defined SQL functions and aggregates in Python.
 .
 If you need a relational database for your applications, or even
 small tools or helper scripts, pysqlite is often a good fit. It's
 easy to use, easy to deploy, and does not depend on any other
 Python libraries or platform libraries, except SQLite. SQLite
 itself is ported to most platforms you'd ever care about.
 .
 It's often a good alternative to MySQL, the Microsoft JET engine
 or the MSDE, without having any of their license and deployment
 issues.

 which is 125/134.2kHz. Frosch Hitag reader/writers are also now supported.
 There's no reason it couldn't work with others, these are just the first ones
 the author got his hands on, and since they present themselves to the O/S as
 standard serial devices without having to install any drivers, it made
 interfacing very simple.

Description: SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper for Python
 SQLAlchemy is an SQL database abstraction library for Python.
 Its strengths are:
  * full power and flexibility of SQL. SQLAlchemy provides a full suite
    of well known enterprise-level persistence patterns, designed for
    efficient and high-performing database access, adapted into a simple
    and Pythonic domain language.
  * extremely easy to use for all the basic tasks, such as: accessing pooled
    connections, constructing SQL from Python expressions, finding object
    instances, and committing object modifications back to the database.
  * powerful enough for complicated tasks, such as: eager load a graph of
    objects and their dependencies via joins; map recursive adjacency
    structures automatically; map objects to not just tables but to any
    arbitrary join or select statement; combine multiple tables together to
    load whole sets of otherwise unrelated objects from a single result set;
    commit entire graphs of object changes in one step.
  * built to conform to what DBAs demand, including the ability to swap out
    generated SQL with hand-optimized statements, full usage of bind parameters
    for all literal values, fully transactionalized and consistent updates
    using Unit of Work.
  * modular. Different parts of SQLAlchemy can be used independently of the
    rest, including the connection pool, SQL construction, and ORM. SQLAlchemy
    is constructed in an open style that allows plenty of customization, with
    an architecture that supports custom datatypes, custom SQL extensions, and
    ORM plugins which can augment or extend mapping functionality.

Version: 1.1.1-2
Depends: python:any (<< 2.8), python:any (>= 2.7~)
Description: ASCII transliterations of Unicode text (Python module)
 It often happens that you have text data in Unicode, but you need to represent
 it in ASCII for display. One could represent non-roman Unicode characters as
 "???" or "\\15BA\\15A0\\1610", but neither is useful to the user reading the
 text.
 .
 Unidecode tries to represent it in ASCII characters (i.e., the universally
 displayable characters between 0x00 and 0x7F), where the compromises taken
 when mapping between two character sets are chosen to be near what a human
 with a US keyboard would choose.
 .
 This module generally produces better results than simply stripping accents
 from characters (which can be done in Python with built-in functions). It is
 based on hand-tuned character mappings that for example also contain ASCII
 approximations for symbols and non-Latin alphabets.
 .
 unidecode is a Python port of the Text::Unidecode Perl module.

Description: Python implementation of the WHATWG Encoding standard
 In order to be compatible with legacy web content when interpreting something
 like Content-Type: text/html; charset=latin1, tools need to use a particular
 set of aliases for encoding labels as well as some overriding rules.  For
 example, US-ASCII and iso-8859-1 on the web are actually aliases for
 windows-1252, and an UTF-8 or UTF-16 BOM takes precedence over any other
 encoding declaration.  The Encoding standard defines all such details so that
 implementations do not have to reverse-engineer each other.
 .
 This module has encoding labels and BOM detection, but the actual
 implementation for encoders and decoders is Python’s.
 .
 This package provides the module for Python 2.

Description: simplify usage of Python decorators by programmers
 Python 2.4 decorators have significantly changed the way Python programs are
 structured.
    * decorators help reduce boilerplate code;
    * decorators help the separation of concerns;
    * decorators enhance readability and maintainability;
    * decorators are very explicit.
 Still, as of now, writing custom decorators correctly requires some
 experience and is not as easy as it could be. For instance, typical
 implementations of decorators involve nested functions and we all know that
 flat is better than nested.
 The aim of the decorator module it to simplify the usage of decorators for
 the average programmer and to popularize decorators usage giving examples of
 useful decorators, such as memoize, tracing, redirecting_stdout, locked, etc.

 of validation you would want for a login form on a website.
 .
 Key features:
 .
   - Good for validating email addresses used for logins/identity.
   - Friendly error messages when validation fails (appropriate to show to
      end users).
   - (optionally) Checks deliverability: Does the domain name resolve?
   - Supports internationalized domain names and (optionally) internationalized
     local parts.
   - Normalizes email addresses (super important for internationalized
     addresses! see below).
 .
 The library is NOT for validation of the To: line in an email message (e.g. My
 Name <my@address.com>), which flanker is more appropriate for. And this library
 does NOT permit obsolete forms of email addresses, so if you need strict
 validation against the email specs exactly, use pyIsEmail.  .
 .

   - Clients no longer see the session information
   - It is possible to securely destroy sessions to protect against replay
     attacks.

Description: small but fast and easy to use stand-alone template engine
 Jinja2 is a template engine written in pure Python. It provides a Django
 inspired non-XML syntax but supports inline expressions and an optional
 sandboxed environment.
 .
 The key-features are:
  * Configurable syntax. If you are generating LaTeX or other formats with
    Jinja2 you can change the delimiters to something that integrates better
    into the LaTeX markup.
  * Fast. While performance is not the primarily target of Jinja2 it’s
    surprisingly fast. The overhead compared to regular Python code was reduced
    to the very minimum.
  * Easy to debug. Jinja2 integrates directly into the Python traceback system
    which allows you to debug Jinja2 templates with regular Python debugging
    helpers.
  * Secure. It’s possible to evaluate untrusted template code if the optional
    sandbox is enabled. This allows Jinja2 to be used as templating language
    for applications where users may modify the template design.

Description: matplotlib toolkit to plot on map projections (Python 3)
 The matplotlib basemap toolkit is a library for plotting 2D data on maps in
 Python. It is similar in functionality to the matlab mapping toolbox, the IDL
 mapping facilities, GrADS, or the Generic Mapping Tools. PyNGL and CDAT are
 other libraries that provide similar capabilities in Python.
 .
 Basemap does not do any plotting on its own, but provides the facilities to
 transform coordinates to one of 23 different map projections (using the PROJ.4
 C library). Matplotlib is then used to plot contours, images, vectors, lines or
 points in the transformed coordinates. Shoreline, river and political boundary
 datasets (from Generic Mapping Tools) are provided, along with methods for
 plotting them. The GEOS library is used internally to clip the coastline and
 political boundary features to the desired map projection region.
 .
 Basemap provides facilities for reading data in netCDF and Shapefile formats,
 as well as directly over http using OPeNDAP. This functionality is provided
 through the PyDAP client, and a Python interface to the Shapefile C library.
 .
 Basemap is geared toward the needs of earth scientists, particular
 oceanographers and meteorologists. The author originally wrote Basemap to help
 in his research (climate and weather forecasting), since at the time CDAT was
 the only other tool in Python for plotting data on map projections. Over the
 years, the capabilities of Basemap have evolved as scientists in other
 disciplines (such as biology, geology and geophysics) requested and contributed
 new features.
 .
 This package contains the Python 3 version of python-mpltoolkits.basemap.

 All the basic PE file structures are available with their default names as
 attributes of the returned instance.
 .
 Processed elements such as the import table are made available with lowercase
 names, to differentiate them from the upper case basic structure names.
 .
 pefile has been tested against the limits of valid PE headers; that is,
 Windows malware. Lots of packed malware attempt to abuse the format beyond its
 standard use.
 .
 Some of the tasks that pefile makes possible are:
  * Modifying and writing back to the PE image
  * Header inspection
  * Section analysis
  * Retrieving data
  * Warnings for suspicious and malformed values
  * Packer detection with PEiD signatures
  * PEiD signature generation

 PLY   is   yet  another   implementation   of   lex   and  yacc   for
 Python.  Although  several  other  parsing tools  are  available  for
 Python, there are  several reasons why you might want  to take a look
 at PLY:
  * It's implemented entirely in Python.
  * It uses  LR-parsing which is reasonably efficient  and well suited
    for larger grammars.
  * PLY  provides most  of  the standard  lex/yacc features  including
    support for  empty productions, precedence  rules, error recovery,
    and support for ambiguous grammars.
  * PLY is  extremely easy  to use and  provides very  extensive error
    checking.

Description: Pure Python PNG Reader/Writer (Python 3)
 The PyPNG module implements support for PNG images. It reads and writes PNG
 files with all allowable bit depths (1/2/4/8/16/24/32/48/64 bits per pixel) and
 colour combinations: greyscale (1/2/4/8/16 bit); RGB, RGBA, LA (greyscale with
 alpha) with 8/16 bits per channel; colour mapped images (1/2/4/8 bit).
 Adam7 interlacing is supported for reading and writing. A number of optional
 chunks can be specified (when writing) and understood (when reading): tRNS,
 bKGD, gAMA.
 .
 PyPNG is not a high level toolkit for image processing (like PIL) and does not
 aim at being a replacement or competitor. Its strength lies in fine-grained
 extensive support of PNG features. It can also read and write Netpbm PAM files,
 with a focus on its use as an intermediate format for implementing custom PNG
 processing.

Description: Python 3 module for PostgreSQL
 psycopg is a PostgreSQL database adapter for the Python3 programming language
 (just like pygresql and popy.) This is version 2, a complete rewrite of the
 original code to provide new-style classes for connection and cursor objects
 and other sweet candies. Like the original, psycopg 2 was written with the
 aim of being very small and fast, and stable as a rock.
 .
 psycopg is different from the other database adapter because it was designed
 for heavily multi-threaded applications that create and destroy lots of
 cursors and make a conspicuous number of concurrent INSERTs or UPDATEs.
 psycopg 2 also provides full asynchronous operations for the really brave
 programmer.
 .
 The main advantages of psycopg2 are that it supports the full Python DBAPI-2.0
 and being thread safe at level 2. It also includes some extensions to the
 standard DBAPI-2.0 to allow for better thread performance.

Description: cryptographic Python library (Python 3)
 PyCryptodome is a self-contained Python package of low-level
 cryptographic primitives.
 .
 PyCryptodome is a fork of PyCrypto. It brings several enhancements
 with respect to the last official version of PyCrypto (2.6.1),
 for instance:
 .
   * Authenticated encryption modes (GCM, CCM, EAX, SIV, OCB)
   * Accelerated AES on Intel platforms via AES-NI
   * First class support for PyPy
   * Elliptic curves cryptography (NIST P-256 curve only)
   * Better and more compact API (`nonce` and `iv` attributes for ciphers,
     automatic generation of random nonces and IVs, simplified CTR cipher mode,
     and more)
   * SHA-3 (including SHAKE XOFs) and BLAKE2 hash algorithms
   * Salsa20 and ChaCha20 stream ciphers
   * scrypt and HKDF
   * Deterministic (EC)DSA
   * Password-protected PKCS#8 key containers
   * Shamir's Secret Sharing scheme
   * Random numbers get sourced directly from the OS (and not from a CSPRNG in
     userspace)
   * Simplified install process, including better support for Windows
   * Cleaner RSA and DSA key generation (largely based on FIPS 186-4)
   * Major clean ups and simplification of the code base
 .
 PyCryptodome is not a wrapper to a separate C library like *OpenSSL*.
 To the largest possible extent, algorithms are implemented in pure Python.
 Only the pieces that are extremely critical to performance (e.g. block ciphers)
 are implemented as C extensions.
 .
 This is the Python 3 version of the package.

Description: SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper for Python 3
 SQLAlchemy is an SQL database abstraction library for Python.
 Its strengths are:
  * full power and flexibility of SQL. SQLAlchemy provides a full suite
    of well known enterprise-level persistence patterns, designed for
    efficient and high-performing database access, adapted into a simple
    and Pythonic domain language.
  * extremely easy to use for all the basic tasks, such as: accessing pooled
    connections, constructing SQL from Python expressions, finding object
    instances, and committing object modifications back to the database.
  * powerful enough for complicated tasks, such as: eager load a graph of
    objects and their dependencies via joins; map recursive adjacency
    structures automatically; map objects to not just tables but to any
    arbitrary join or select statement; combine multiple tables together to
    load whole sets of otherwise unrelated objects from a single result set;
    commit entire graphs of object changes in one step.
  * built to conform to what DBAs demand, including the ability to swap out
    generated SQL with hand-optimized statements, full usage of bind parameters
    for all literal values, fully transactionalized and consistent updates
    using Unit of Work.
  * modular. Different parts of SQLAlchemy can be used independently of the
    rest, including the connection pool, SQL construction, and ORM. SQLAlchemy
    is constructed in an open style that allows plenty of customization, with
    an architecture that supports custom datatypes, custom SQL extensions, and
    ORM plugins which can augment or extend mapping functionality.

Version: 1.1.1-3
Depends: python3:any
Description: ASCII transliterations of Unicode text (Python 3 module)
 It often happens that you have text data in Unicode, but you need to represent
 it in ASCII for display. One could represent non-roman Unicode characters as
 "???" or "\\15BA\\15A0\\1610", but neither is useful to the user reading the
 text.
 .
 Unidecode tries to represent it in ASCII characters (i.e., the universally
 displayable characters between 0x00 and 0x7F), where the compromises taken
 when mapping between two character sets are chosen to be near what a human
 with a US keyboard would choose.
 .
 This module generally produces better results than simply stripping accents
 from characters (which can be done in Python with built-in functions). It is
 based on hand-tuned character mappings that for example also contain ASCII
 approximations for symbols and non-Latin alphabets.
 .
 unidecode is a Python 3 port of the Text::Unidecode Perl module.

Description: Python implementation of the WHATWG Encoding standard
 In order to be compatible with legacy web content when interpreting something

 example, US-ASCII and iso-8859-1 on the web are actually aliases for
 windows-1252, and an UTF-8 or UTF-16 BOM takes precedence over any other
 encoding declaration.  The Encoding standard defines all such details so that
 implementations do not have to reverse-engineer each other.

 This module has encoding labels and BOM detection, but the actual
 implementation for encoders and decoders is Python’s.

Description: fast processor emulator, dummy package
 QEMU is a fast processor emulator. Once upon a time there was only one
 package named `qemu', with all functionality included. These days, qemu
 become large and has been split into numerous packages. Different packages
 provides entirely different services, and it is very unlikely one will
 need all of them together. So current `qemu' package makes no sense anymore,
 and is becoming a dummy package.
 .
 If you want full system emulation of some architecture, install one or more
 of qemu-system-ARCH packages. If you want user-mode emulation, install
 qemu-user pr qemu-user-static package. If you need utilities, use qemu-utils
 package.

 retrieves this information from the monitor via the Data Display
 Channel (DDC).
 .
 get-edid uses architecture-specific methods for querying the video
 hardware (real-mode x86 instructions on i386, Open Firmware device
 tree parsing on PowerMac) and is therefore only available for i386 and
 powerpc architectures.
 .
 parse-edid parses this data structure and outputs data suitable for
 inclusion into the XFree86 or X.org configuration file. It is available
 for any architecture.

 Rebind is a tool that implements the multiple A record DNS

 to target home routers, it can be used to target any public

 .
 Rebind provides an external attacker access to a target
 router's internal Web interface. This tool works on routers
 that implement the weak end system model in their IP stack,
 have specifically configured firewall rules, and who bind
 their Web service to the router's WAN interface. Note that
 remote administration does not need to be enabled for this
 attack to work. All that is required is that a user inside
 the target network surf to a Web site that is controlled,
 or has been compromised, by the attacker.

 conducted quickly and thoroughly.
 .
 Recon-ng has a look and feel similar to the Metasploit Framework, reducing the
 learning curve for leveraging the framework. However, it is quite different.
 Recon-ng is not intended to compete with existing frameworks, as it is designed
 exclusively for web-based open source reconnaissance. If you want to exploit,
 use the Metasploit Framework. If you want to Social Engineer, use the Social
 Engineer Toolkit.

 thus the redirection is system-wide, with fine-grained control, and does
 not depend on LD_PRELOAD libraries.
 .
 Redsocks supports tunneling TCP connections and UDP packets. It has
 authentication support for both, SOCKS and HTTP proxies.
 .
 Also included is a small DNS server returning answers with the "truncated" flag
 set for any UDP query, forcing the resolver to use TCP.

 information (keys, values, data) from the Registry and presenting it for
 analysis.
 .
 RegRipper consists of two basic tools, both of which provide similar
 capability. The RegRipper GUI allows the analyst to select a hive to parse, an
 output file for the results, and a profile (list of plugins) to run against the
 hive. When the analyst launches the tool against the hive, the results go to
 the file that the analyst designated. If the analyst chooses to parse the
 System hive, they might also choose to send the results to system.txt. The GUI
 tool
 will also create a log of it's activity in the same directory as the output
 file, using the same file name but using the .log extension (i.e., if the
 output is written to system.txt, the log will be written to system.log).

Description: name server information handler
 Resolvconf is a framework for keeping up to date the system's
 information about name servers. It sets itself up as the intermediary
 between programs that supply this information (such as ifup and
 ifdown, DHCP clients, the PPP daemon and local name servers) and
 programs that use this information (such as DNS caches and resolver
 libraries).
 .
 This package may require some manual configuration. Please

Description: LLMNR/NBT-NS/mDNS Poisoner
 This package contains Responder/MultiRelay,  an LLMNR, NBT-NS and MDNS
 poisoner. It will answer to specific NBT-NS (NetBIOS Name Service) queries
 based on their name suffix (see: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/163409). By
 default, the tool will only answer to File Server Service request, which is for
 SMB.
 .
 The concept behind this is to target your answers, and be stealthier on the
 network. This also helps to ensure that you don't break legitimate NBT-NS
 behavior. You can set the -r option via command line if you want to answer
 to the Workstation Service request name suffix.

 Rifiuti2 analyses recycle bin files from Windows. Analysis of Windows
 recycle bin is usually carried out during Windows computer forensics.
 .
 Rifiuti2 can extract file deletion time, original path and size of deleted
 files and whether the deleted files have been moved out from the recycle
 bin since they are trashed.
 .
 Rifiuti2 is a rewrite of rifiuti, which is originally written for identical
 purpose. Then it was extended to cover more functionalities, such as:
 .
   * Handles recycle bin up to Windows 10;
   * Handles ancient Windows like 95, NT4 and ME;
   * Supports all localized versions of Windows - both Unicode-based ones
     and legacy ones (using ANSI code page);
   * Supports output in XML format as well as original tab-delimited text.
 .
 Rifiuti2 is designed to be portable and runs on command line environment. Two
 programs rifiuti and rifiuti-vista are chosen depending on relevant Windows
 recycle bin format.

Description: Ruby/EventMachine library
 EventMachine implements a fast, single-threaded engine for arbitrary network

 interactions with IP sockets, allowing programs to concentrate on the
 implementation of network protocols. It can be used to create both network
 servers and clients. To create a server or client, a Ruby program only needs
 to specify the IP address and port, and provide a Module that implements the
 communications protocol. Implementations of several standard network protocols
 are provided with the package, primarily to serve as examples. The real goal
 of EventMachine is to enable programs to easily interface with other programs
 using TCP/IP, especially if custom protocols are required.

Suggests: ruby-test-unit
Description: Ruby test tools supporting TDD, BDD, mocking, and benchmarking
 minitest provides a complete suite of testing facilities supporting
 TDD, BDD, mocking, and benchmarking.
 .
 minitest/unit is a small and incredibly fast unit testing framework.
 It provides a rich set of assertions to make your tests clean and
 readable.
 .
 minitest/spec is a functionally complete spec engine. It hooks onto
 minitest/unit and seamlessly bridges test assertions over to spec
 expectations.
 .
 minitest/benchmark is an awesome way to assert the performance of your
 algorithms in a repeatable manner. Now you can assert that your newb
 co-worker doesn't replace your linear algorithm with an exponential
 one!
 .
 minitest/mock by Steven Baker, is a beautifully tiny mock object
 framework.
 .
 minitest/pride shows pride in testing and adds coloring to your test
 output.
 .
 minitest/unit is meant to have a clean implementation for language
 implementors that need a minimal set of methods to bootstrap a working
 test suite. For example, there is no magic involved for test-case
 discovery.

Description: Ruby library providing a selector API for monitoring IO objects
 nio4r (New IO for Ruby) provides an abstract, cross-platform stateful
 I/O selector API for Ruby. I/O selectors are the heart of
 "reactor"-based event loops, and monitor multiple I/O objects for
 various types of readiness, e.g. ready for reading or writing.
 .
 The most similar API provided by Ruby today is Kernel.select, however
 the select API requires you to pass in arrays of all of the I/O
 objects you're interested in every time. nio4r provides a more
 object-oriented API that lets you register I/O objects with a selector
 then handle them when they're selected for various types of events.
 .
 nio4r is modeled after the Java NIO API, but simplified for
 ease-of-use.
 .
 Its goals are:
 .
  * Expose high-level interfaces for stateful IO selectors.
  * Keep the API small to maximize both portability and performance across
    many different OSes and Ruby VMs.
  * Provide inherently thread-safe facilities for working with IO objects.

Description: GNOME UPnP/DLNA services
 Rygel is a home media solution that allows you to easily share audio, video
 and pictures, and control of media player on your home network. In technical
 terms it is both a UPnP AV MediaServer and MediaRenderer implemented through
 a plug-in mechanism. Interoperability with other devices in the market is
 achieved by conformance to very strict requirements of DLNA and on the fly
 conversion of media to format that client devices are capable of handling.
 .
 This package contains the core of Rygel and following plugins:
   * media-export: Recursively exports folders and files specified in the
     user configuration. This plugin supports all types of URIs that
     gio/gvfs and GStreamer can handle.
   * external: A MediaServer plugin that exports media hierarchies
     provided by external applications.
   * mpris: Export of media players that implement MPRIS2 D-Bus interface,
     as MediaRenderer devices.

Architecture: amd64
Version: 1.7-4
Depends: libc6 (>= 2.15)
Description: data recovery tool for problematic or damaged media
 Safecopy tries to get as much data from SOURCE as possible, even resorting
 to device specific low level operations if applicable. This is achieved by
 identifying problematic or damaged areas, skipping over them and continuing
 reading afterwards. The corresponding area in the destination file is either
 skipped (on initial creation that means padded with zeros) or deliberately
 filled with a recognizable pattern to later find affected files on a corrupted
 device. The work is similar to ddrescue, generating an image of the original
 media. This media can be floppy disks, harddisk partitions, CDs, DVDs, tape
 devices, where other tools like dd would fail due to I/O errors.
 .
 Safecopy uses an incremental algorithm to identify the exact beginning and
 end of bad areas, allowing the user to trade minimum accesses to bad areas
 for thorough data resurrection.
 .
 Multiple passes over the same file are possible, to first retrieve as much
 data from a device as possible with minimum harm, and then trying to retrieve
 some of the remaining data with increasingly aggressive read attempts.
 .
 Safecopy includes a low level I/O layer to read CDROM disks in raw mode,
 and issue device resets and other helpful low level operations on a number
 of other device classes.
 .
 Safecopy is useful in forensics investigations and disaster recovery.

Description: SMB/CIFS file, print, and login server for Unix
 Samba is an implementation of the SMB/CIFS protocol for Unix systems,
 providing support for cross-platform file and printer sharing with
 Microsoft Windows, OS X, and other Unix systems.  Samba can also function
 as an NT4-style domain controller, and can integrate with both NT4 domains
 and Active Directory realms as a member server.
 .
 This package provides the components necessary to use Samba as a stand-alone
 file and print server or as an NT4 or Active Directory domain controller.
 For use in an NT4 domain or Active Directory realm, you will also need the
 winbind package.
 .
 This package is not required for connecting to existing SMB/CIFS servers
 (see smbclient) or for mounting remote filesystems (see cifs-utils).

Description: tools for forensics analysis on volume and filesystem data
 The Sleuth Kit, also known as TSK, is a collection of UNIX-based command
 line file and volume system forensic analysis tools. The filesystem tools
 allow you to examine filesystems of a suspect computer in a non-intrusive
 fashion. Because the tools do not rely on the operating system to process the
 filesystems, deleted and hidden content is shown.
 .
 The volume system (media management) tools allow you to examine the layout of
 disks and other media. You can also recover deleted files, get information
 stored in slack spaces, examine filesystems journal, see partitions layout on
 disks or images etc. But is very important clarify that the TSK acts over the
 current filesystem only.
 .
 The Sleuth Kit supports DOS partitions, BSD partitions (disk labels), Mac
 partitions, Sun slices (Volume Table of Contents), and GPT disks. With these
 tools, you can identify where partitions are located and extract them so that
 they can be analyzed with filesystem analysis tools.
 .
 Currently, TSK supports several filesystems, as NTFS, FAT, exFAT, HFS+, Ext3,
 Ext4, UFS and YAFFS2.
 .
 This package contains the set of command line tools in The Sleuth Kit.

Description: FastCGI process spawner
 Allows FastCGI processes to be separated from web server process :
   * Easy creation of chmoded socket.
   * Privilege separation without needing a suid-binary,
     or running a server as root.
   * You can restart your web server and the FastCGI applications
     without restarting the others.
   * You can run them in different chroot()s.
   * Running your FastCGI applications doesn’t depend on the web server
     you are running, which allows for easier testing of/migration
     to other web servers.

 interface, without the need to learn complicated SQL commands.
 Controls and wizards are available for users to:
  - Create and compact database files
  - Create, define, modify and delete tables
  - Create, define and delete indexes
  - Browse, edit, add and delete records
  - Search records
  - Import and export records as text
  - Import and export tables from/to CSV files
  - Import and export databases from/to SQL dump files
  - Issue SQL queries and inspect the results
  - Examine a log of all SQL commands issued by the application
 .
 SQLite Database Browser is not a visual shell for the sqlite command line
 tool. It does not require familiarity with SQL commands.

 Block sizes greater than 4K are supported up to a maximum of 64K.
 .
 Squashfs is intended for general read-only filesystem use, for archival use
 (i.e. in cases where a .tar.gz file may be used), and in constrained block
 device/memory systems (e.g. embedded systems) where low overhead is needed.

 supports all the major features of CVS, but has evolved to support
 many features that CVS users often wish they had.
 .
 This package includes the Subversion client (svn, svnsync), repository
 administration tools (svnadmin, svnlook) and a network server (svnserve).

 sucrack is a multithreaded Linux/UNIX tool for cracking local
 user accounts via wordlist bruteforcing su. This tool comes in
 handy when you've gained access to a low-privilege user account
 but are allowed to su to other users. Many su implementations
 require a pseudo terminal to be attached in order to take the
 password from the user. This can't be easily achieved with a
 simple shell script. This tool, written in C, is highly
 efficient and can attempt multiple logins at the same time.

Version: 1.41-3

Description: Collection of simple Type 1 font manipulation programs
 The t1utils tools allow you to convert between PFA (ASCII) and PFB
 (binary) formats; disassemble PFA or PFB files into human-readable
 form; and reassemble the human-readable files into PFA or PFB format
 files.  You can also  extract font resources from a Macintosh font
 file (ATM/Laserwriter), or create a Macintosh Type 1 font file from a
 PFA or PFB font.
 .
 There are currently six programs:
 .
  t1ascii   Converts PFB files to PFA format.
 .
  t1binary  Converts PFA files to PFB format.
 .
  t1disasm  Disassembles a Type 1 font (PFA or PFB format) into a raw,
            human-readable text form for subsequent hand editing,
            tweaking, hint fixing, etcetera...
 .
  t1asm     Assembles a Type 1 font into PFA or PFB format from
            the human-readable form produced by t1disasm.
 .
  t1unmac   Extracts POST resources from a Macintosh Type 1 font file
            (ATM/Laserwriter) into PFA or PFB format for use outside
            the Macintosh environment.  The Macintosh file should be
            stored in MacBinary, AppleSingle, AppleDouble, or BinHex
            format, or as a raw resource fork.  Note that t1unmac does
            not have to run on a Macintosh, but makes Macintosh Type 1
            fonts available for use on Unix machines and PCs.
 .
  t1mac     Creates a Macintosh Type 1 file from a PFA- or PFB-format
            Type 1 font. Writes the Macintosh file in MacBinary,
            AppleSingle, AppleDouble, or BinHex format, or as a raw
            resource fork.  WARNING: This tool will not suffice to
            allow you to use the new font on a Macintosh, as
            Macintoshes cannot read raw Type 1 fonts.  You will need
            to create a font suitcase containing bitmap fonts.  If you
            do not already have such a suitcase for the font, T1utils
            will not help you create one.

Description: TCP flow recorder
 tcpflow is a program that captures data transmitted as part of TCP
 connections (flows), and stores the data in a way that is convenient
 for protocol analysis or debugging. A program like 'tcpdump' shows a
 summary of packets seen on the wire, but usually doesn't store the
 data that's actually being transmitted. In contrast, tcpflow
 reconstructs the actual data streams and stores each flow in a
 separate file for later analysis.
 .
 tcpflow understands sequence numbers and will correctly reconstruct
 data streams regardless of retransmissions or out-of-order delivery.
 However, it currently does not understand IP fragments; flows
 containing IP fragments will not be recorded properly.
 .
 tcpflow is based on the LBL Packet Capture Library and therefore
 supports the same rich filtering expressions that programs like
 'tcpdump' support. tcpflow can also rebuild flows from data captured
 with 'tcpdump -w'.

Description: Tool to replay saved tcpdump files at arbitrary speeds
 Tcpreplay is aimed at testing the performance of a NIDS by
 replaying real background network traffic in which to hide
 attacks. Tcpreplay allows you to control the speed at which the
 traffic is replayed, and can replay arbitrary tcpdump traces. Unlike
 programmatically-generated artificial traffic which doesn't
 exercise the application/protocol inspection that a NIDS performs,
 and doesn't reproduce the real-world anomalies that appear on
 production networks (asymmetric routes, traffic bursts/lulls,
 fragmentation, retransmissions, etc.), tcpreplay allows for exact
 replication of real traffic seen on real networks. It included the following
 executables tcpprep, tcprewrite, tcpreplay-edit, tcpbridge and pcap
 based captures are possible.

 The telnet command is used for interactive communication with another host

 For the purpose of remote login, the present client executable should be
 depreciated in favour of an ssh-client, or in some cases with variants like
 telnet-ssl or Kerberized TELNET clients.  The most important reason is that
 this implementation exchanges user name and password in clear text.
 .
 On the other hand, the present program does satisfy common use cases of
 network diagnostics, like protocol testing of SMTP services, so it can
 become handy enough.

Description: Stress tester for the SSL handshake
 THC-SSL-DOS is a tool to verify the performance of SSL.
 .
 Establishing a secure SSL connection requires 15x more processing
 power on the server than on the client.
 .
 THC-SSL-DOS exploits this asymmetric property by overloading the
 server and knocking it off the Internet.
 .
 This problem affects all SSL implementations today. The vendors are aware
 of this problem since 2003 and the topic has been widely discussed.
 .
 This attack further exploits the SSL secure Renegotiation feature
 to trigger thousands of renegotiations via single TCP connection.

Description: virtual network computing server software
 VNC stands for Virtual Network Computing. It is, in essence, a remote
 display system which allows you to view a computing `desktop' environment
 not only on the machine where it is running, but from anywhere on the
 Internet and from a wide variety of machine architectures.
 .
 This package provides a server to which X clients can connect and the
 server generates a display that can be viewed with a vncviewer.
 .
 The difference between the tightvncserver and the normal vncserver is the
 data encoding, optimized for low bandwidth connections. If the client do not
 support jpeg or zlib encoding it can use the default one. Later versions of
 vncserver (> 3.3.3r2) support a new automatic encoding that should be equally
 good as the tightvnc encoding.
 .
 Note: This server does not support or need a display. You need a vncviewer to
 see something. However, this viewer may also be on a computer running other
 operating systems in the local net.

 windows linked to it. Any number of clients may connect to a session,
 or the server may be controlled by issuing commands with tmux.
 Communication takes place through a socket, by default placed in /tmp.
 Moreover tmux provides a consistent and well-documented command
 interface, with the same syntax whether used interactively, as a key
 binding, or from the shell. It offers a choice of vim or Emacs key
 layouts.

Description: anonymizing overlay network for TCP
 Tor is a connection-based low-latency anonymous communication system.
 .
 Clients choose a source-routed path through a set of relays, and
 negotiate a "virtual circuit" through the network, in which each relay
 knows its predecessor and successor, but no others. Traffic flowing
 down the circuit is decrypted at each relay, which reveals the
 downstream relay.
 .
 Basically, Tor provides a distributed network of relays. Users bounce
 their TCP streams (web traffic, ftp, ssh, etc) around the relays, and
 recipients, observers, and even the relays themselves have difficulty
 learning which users connected to which destinations.
 .
 This package enables only a Tor client by default, but it can also be
 configured as a relay and/or a hidden service easily.
 .
 Client applications can use the Tor network by connecting to the local
 socks proxy interface provided by your Tor instance. If the application
 itself does not come with socks support, you can use a socks client
 such as torsocks.
 .
 Note that Tor does no protocol cleaning on application traffic. There
 is a danger that application protocols and associated programs can be
 induced to reveal information about the user. Tor depends on Torbutton
 and similar protocol cleaners to solve this problem. For best
 protection when web surfing, the Tor Project recommends that you use
 the Tor Browser Bundle, a standalone tarball that includes static
 builds of Tor, Torbutton, and a modified Firefox that is patched to fix
 a variety of privacy bugs.

Description: GeoIP database for Tor
 This package provides a GeoIP database for Tor, i.e. it maps IPv4 addresses

 .
 Bridge relays (special Tor relays that aren't listed in the main Tor
 directory) use this information to report which countries they see
 connections from.  These statistics enable the Tor network operators to
 learn when certain countries start blocking access to bridges.
 .
 Clients can also use this to learn what country each relay is in, so
 Tor controllers like arm or Vidalia can use it, or if they want to
 configure path selection preferences.

Description: Update Configuration File(s): preserve user changes to config files
 Debian policy mandates that user changes to configuration files must be
 preserved during package upgrades. The easy way to achieve this behavior
 is to make the configuration file a 'conffile', in which case dpkg
 handles the file specially during upgrades, prompting the user as
 needed.
 .
 This is appropriate only if it is possible to distribute a default
 version that will work for most installations, although some system
 administrators may choose to modify it. This implies that the
 default version will be part of the package distribution, and must
 not be modified by the maintainer scripts during installation (or at
 any other time).
 .
 This script attempts to provide conffile-like handling for files that
 may not be labelled conffiles, and are not shipped in a Debian package,
 but handled by the postinst instead. This script allows one to
 maintain files in /etc, preserving user changes and in general
 offering the same facilities while upgrading that dpkg normally
 provides for 'conffiles'.
 .
 Additionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a
 file that had not been provided with conffile-like protection to come
 under this schema, and attempts to minimize questions asked at
 installation time. Indeed, the transitioning facility is better than the
 one offered by dpkg while transitioning a file from a non-conffile to
 conffile status.

Description: mode switching tool for controlling "flip flop" USB devices
 Several new USB devices have their proprietary Windows drivers onboard,
 especially WAN dongles. When plugged in for the first time, they act
 like a flash storage and start installing the driver from there. If
 the driver is already installed, the storage device vanishes and
 a new device, such as an USB modem, shows up. This is called the
 "ZeroCD" feature.
 .
 On Debian, this is not needed, since the driver is included as a
 Linux kernel module, such as "usbserial". However, the device still
 shows up as "usb-storage" by default. usb-modeswitch solves that
 issue by sending the command which actually performs the switching
 of the device from "usb-storage" to "usbserial".
 .
 This package contains the binaries and the brother scripts.

Description: runtime components for the Universally Unique ID library
 The libuuid library generates and parses 128-bit Universally Unique
 IDs (UUIDs). A UUID is an identifier that is unique within the space
 of all such identifiers across both space and time. It can be used for
 multiple purposes, from tagging objects with an extremely short lifetime
 to reliably identifying very persistent objects across a network.
 .
 See RFC 4122 for more information.
 .
 This package contains the uuidgen program and the uuidd daemon.
 .
 The uuidd daemon is used to generate UUIDs, especially time-based
 UUIDs, in a secure and guaranteed-unique fashion, even in the face of
 large numbers of threads trying to grab UUIDs running on different CPUs.
 It is used by libuuid as well as the uuidgen program.

 Please note that these integration scripts only supports a limited
 set of interface naming schemes, which means you might be better
 off with writing your own ifupdown hooks using ip(route2)
 directly in /etc/network/interfaces rather than using this package.
 .
 It currently also ships a wrapper script for backwards compatibility
 called vconfig, that replaces the old deprecated vconfig program
 with translations to ip(route2) commands.
 This compatibility shim might be dropped in future releases, please
 use ip(route2) commands directly.

Description: advanced memory forensics framework
 The Volatility Framework is a completely open collection of tools for
 the extraction of digital artifacts from volatile memory (RAM) samples.
 It is useful in forensics analysis. The extraction techniques are
 performed completely independent of the system being investigated but
 offer unprecedented visibility into the runtime state of the system.
 .
 Volatility supports memory dumps from all major 32- and 64-bit Windows
 versions and service packs. Whether your memory dump is in raw format,
 a Microsoft crash dump, hibernation file, or virtual machine snapshot,
 Volatility is able to work with it.
 .
 Linux memory dumps in raw or LiME format are supported too. There are
 several plugins for analyzing memory dumps from 32- and 64-bit Linux
 kernels and relevant distributions such as Debian, Ubuntu, openSUSE,
 RedHat, Fedora, CentOS, Mandriva, etc.
 .
 Volatility also support several versions of Mac OSX memory dumps, both
 32- and 64-bit. Android phones with ARM processors are also supported.
 .
 These are some of the data that can be extracted from a memory image:
    - Image information (date, time, CPU count);
    - Running processes;
    - Open network sockets and connections;
    - OS kernel modules loaded;
    - Memory maps for each process;
    - Executables samples;
    - Command history;
    - Suspicious process mappings (i.e. injected code);
    - Passwords, as LM/NTLM hashes and LSA secrets;
    - Cached Truecrypt passphrases;
    - Others.
 .

 This package identifies and fingerprints Web Application Firewall (WAF)

  - Sends a _normal_ HTTP request and analyses the response; this identifies a
    number of WAF solutions.
  - If that is not successful, it sends a number of (potentially malicious)
    HTTP requests and uses simple logic to deduce which WAF it is.
  - If that is also not successful, it analyses the responses previously
    returned and uses another simple algorithm to guess if a WAF or security
    solution is actively responding to the attacks.

Description: web application vulnerability scanner
 Wapiti allows you to audit the security of your web applications.
 It performs "black-box" scans, i.e. it does not study the source code of the
 application but will scan the web pages of the deployed web applications,
 looking for scripts and forms where it can inject data.
 Once it gets this list, Wapiti acts like a fuzzer, injecting payloads to see
 if a script is vulnerable.
 .
 Wapiti can detect the following vulnerabilities:
  - Database Injection (PHP/ASP/JSP SQL Injections and XPath Injections)
  - Cross Site Scripting (XSS) reflected and permanent
  - File disclosure detection (local and remote include, require, fopen,
    readfile...)
  - Command Execution detection (eval(), system(), passtru()...)
  - XXE (Xml eXternal Entity) injection
  - CRLF Injection
  - Search for potentially dangerous files on the server (thank to the Nikto db)
  - Bypass of weak htaccess configurations
  - Search for copies (backup) of scripts on the server
  - Shellshock
  - DirBuster like
  - Server Side Request Forgery (through use of an external Wapiti website)

 WCE can perform this task without injecting code, just by reading and
 decrypting information stored in Windows internal memory structures. It also
 has the capability to automatically switch to code injection when the
 aforementioned method cannot be performed.

Description: retrieves files from the web
 Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the web
 using HTTP(S) and FTP, the two most widely used internet
 protocols. It works non-interactively, so it will work in
 the background, after having logged off. The program supports
 recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as FTP
 sites -- you can use Wget to make mirrors of archives and
 home pages or to travel the web like a WWW robot.
 .
 Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections
 by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully
 downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on
 servers (both HTTP and FTP) that support it. Both HTTP and FTP
 retrievals can be time stamped, so Wget can see if the remote
 file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically
 retrieve the new version if it has.
 .
 Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load,
 speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.

 easier, rather than having five windows all this is done in

 to see what is going on. All sessions are labelled so you

 A number of terms are used to refer to the X Window System, including "X",
 "X Version 11", "X11", "X11R6", and "X11R7".  The version of X used in
 Debian is derived from the version released by the X.Org Foundation, and
 is thus often also referred to as "X.Org".  All of the preceding quoted
 terms are functionally interchangeable in an Debian system.

Description: X server utilities
 An X client is a program that interfaces with an X server (almost always via
 the X libraries), and thus with some input and output hardware like a
 graphics card, monitor, keyboard, and pointing device (such as a mouse).
 .
 This package provides a miscellaneous assortment of X Server utilities
 that ship with the X Window System, including:
  - iceauth, a tool for manipulating ICE protocol authorization records;
  - rgb;
  - sessreg, a simple program for managing utmp/wtmp entries;
  - xcmsdb, a device color characteristic utility for the X Color Management
    System;
  - xgamma, a tool for querying and setting a monitor's gamma correction;
  - xhost, a very dangerous program that you should never use;
  - xmodmap, a utility for modifying keymaps and pointer button mappings in X;
  - xrandr, a command-line interface to the RandR extension;
  - xrdb, a tool to manage the X server resource database;
  - xrefresh, a tool that forces a redraw of the X screen;
  - xset, a tool for setting miscellaneous X server parameters;
  - xsetmode and xsetpointer, tools for handling X Input devices;
  - xsetroot, a tool for tailoring the appearance of the root window;
  - xstdcmap, a utility to selectively define standard colormap properties;
  - xvidtune, a tool for customizing X server modelines for your monitor.

 released.  The default behaviour is to generate the Escape key when Left
 Control is pressed and released on its own.

Description: desktop integration portal for Flatpak and Snap
 xdg-desktop-portal provides a portal frontend service for Flatpak, Snap,
 and possibly other desktop containment/sandboxing frameworks. This service
 is made available to the sandboxed application, and provides mediated
 D-Bus interfaces for file access, URI opening, printing and similar
 desktop integration features.
 .
 The implementation of these interfaces is expected to require
 user confirmation before responding to the sandboxed application's
 requests. For example, when the sandboxed application ask to open a file,
 the portal implementation will open an "Open" dialog outside the sandbox,
 and will only make the selected file available to the sandboxed app if
 that dialog is confirmed.
 .
 xdg-desktop-portal is designed to be desktop-agnostic, and uses a
 desktop-environment-specific GUI backend such as xdg-desktop-portal-gtk
 to provide its functionality.

Description: tool to manage well known user directories
 xdg-user-dirs is a tool to help manage "well known" user directories
 like the desktop folder and the music folder. It also handles
 localization (i.e. translation) of the filenames.
 .
 The way it works is that xdg-user-dirs-update is run very early in the
 login phase. This program reads a configuration file, and a set of
 default directories. It then creates localized versions of these
 directories in the users home directory and sets up a config file in
 $(XDG_CONFIG_HOME)/user-dirs.dirs (XDG_CONFIG_HOME defaults to
 ~/.config) that applications can read to find these directories.

Description: window manager of the Xfce project
 This package contains xfwm4 which is the window manager for Xfce4.  It is
 designed to run with the rest of Xfce4 but makes a capable window manager
 for GNOME or KDE.
 .
 Install xfwm4 if you want a small, resource saving window manager which
 complies to the standards defined at http://www.freedesktop.org/. Without
 xfce4 installed this only gives you a window manager not the full
 environment.

 returned answers.
 .
 Xprobe2's functionality is comparable to the OS fingerprinting feature
 in nmap (written by a different Fyodor):
  - Outputs its level of confidence about the OS on the remote host.
  - Remains usable even if intermediate systems (routers, firewalls) make
    slight modifications to the packets.
  - Can list the type of intermediate device (e.g. "Linux IP masquerading").
  - Modular architecture allows new fingerprinting tests and new OS
    signatures to be added.

Description: X terminal emulator
 xterm is a terminal emulator for the X Window System.  It provides DEC VT102
 and Tektronix 4014 compatible terminals for programs that cannot use the
 window system directly.  This version implements ISO/ANSI colors and most of
 the control sequences used by DEC VT220 terminals.
 .
 This package provides four commands: xterm, which is the traditional
 terminal emulator; uxterm, which is a wrapper around xterm that is
 intelligent about locale settings (especially those which use the UTF-8
 character encoding), but which requires the luit program from the x11-utils
 package; koi8rxterm, a wrapper similar to uxterm for locales that use the
 KOI8-R character set; and lxterm, a simple wrapper that chooses which of the
 previous commands to execute based on the user's locale settings.
 .
 A complete list of control sequences supported by the X terminal emulator
 is provided in /usr/share/doc/xterm.
 .
 The xterm program uses bitmap images provided by the xbitmaps package.
 .
 Those interested in using koi8rxterm will likely want to install the
 xfonts-cyrillic package as well.

Description: virtual network computing client software for X
 VNC stands for Virtual Network Computing. It is, in essence, a remote
 display system which allows you to view a computing `desktop' environment
 not only on the machine where it is running, but from anywhere on the
 Internet and from a wide variety of machine architectures.
 .
 It is implemented in a client/server model. This package provides a client
 for X, with this you can connect to a vncserver somewhere in the network
 and display its content in a window. There are vncserver available for other
 operating systems.
 .
 The difference between the xtightvncviewer and the normal vncviewer is the
 data encoding, optimized for low bandwidth connections. If the client do not
 support jpeg or zlib encoding it can use the default one. Later versions of
 xvncviewer (> 3.3.3r2) support a new automatic encoding that should be equally
 good as the tightvnc encoding.

Description: XZ-format compression utilities
 XZ is the successor to the Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain Algorithm
 compression format, which provides memory-hungry but powerful
 compression (often better than bzip2) and fast, easy decompression.
 .
 This package provides the command line tools for working with XZ
 compression, including xz, unxz, xzcat, xzgrep, and so on. They can
 also handle the older LZMA format, and if invoked via appropriate
 symlinks will emulate the behavior of the commands in the lzma
 package.
 .
 The XZ format is similar to the older LZMA format but includes some
 improvements for general use:
 .
  * 'file' magic for detecting XZ files;
  * crc64 data integrity check;
  * limited random-access reading support;
  * improved support for multithreading (not used in xz-utils);
  * support for flushing the encoder.

Description: zero free blocks from ext2, ext3 and ext4 file-systems
 Zerofree finds the unallocated blocks with non-zero value content in
 an ext2, ext3 or ext4 file-system and fills them with zeroes
 (zerofree can also work with another value than zero). This is mostly
 useful if the device on which this file-system resides is a disk
 image. In this case, depending on the type of disk image, a secondary
 utility may be able to reduce the size of the disk image after
 zerofree has been run. Zerofree requires the file-system to be
 unmounted or mounted read-only.
 .
 The usual way to achieve the same result (zeroing the unused
 blocks) is to run "dd" to create a file full of zeroes that takes up
 the entire free space on the drive, and then delete this file. This
 has many disadvantages, which zerofree alleviates:
  * it is slow;
  * it makes the disk image (temporarily) grow to its maximal extent;
  * it (temporarily) uses all free space on the disk, so other
    concurrent write actions may fail.
 .
 Zerofree has been written to be run from GNU/Linux systems installed
 as guest OSes inside a virtual machine. If this is not your case, you
 almost certainly don't need this package. (One other use case would
 be to erase sensitive data a little bit more securely than with a
 simple "rm").

Description: shell with lots of features
 Zsh is a UNIX command interpreter (shell) usable as an
 interactive login shell and as a shell script command
 processor. Of the standard shells, zsh most closely resembles
 ksh but includes many enhancements. Zsh has command-line editing,
 built-in spelling correction, programmable command completion,
 shell functions (with autoloading), a history mechanism, and a
 host of other features.
